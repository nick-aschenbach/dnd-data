[{"name":"Aarakocra","description":"A winged people who originated on the Elemental Plane of Air, aarakocra soar through the sky wherever they wander. The first aarakocra served the Wind Dukes of Aaqa—mighty beings of air—and were imbued with a measure of their masters’ power over winds. Their descendants still command echoes of that power. From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Standing upright, aarakocra are typically about 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies—usually red, orange, yellow, brown, or gray. Their heads are also avian, often resembling those of parrots or eagles. Aarakocra Traits As an aarakocra, you have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Flight. Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can’t use this flying speed if you’re wearing medium or heavy armor. Talons. You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Wind Caller. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the gust of wind spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it when you cast gust of wind with this trait (choose when you select this race).","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":14934},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Mordenkainen Presents - Monsters of the Multiverse"},{"name":"Aarakocra","description":"Many people across Wildemount consider the winged aarakocra to be a myth, so infrequently do they descend from their lofty aeries to deal with wingless folk.

These folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrous hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often attempt to pass as humans in order to right wrongs and defend goodness on the Material Plane without drawing undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive to fit into society, although they usually rise to the top, becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes. You might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpoint to the tiefling race. The two races could even be at odds, reflecting some greater conflict between the forces of good and evil in your campaign. Here are our basic goals for the aasimar: Aasimar should make effective clerics and paladins. Aasimar should be to celestials and humans what tieflings are to fiends and humans. Given that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of the same coin, the tiefling makes a good starting point for coming up with the new race’s traits. Since we want aasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it makes sense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead of Intelligence and Charisma. Like tieflings, aasimar have darkvision. Instead of resistance to fire damage, we give them resistance to radiant damage to reflect their celestial nature. However, radiant damage isn’t as common as fire damage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage as well, making them good at facing undead. The tiefling’s Infernal Legacy trait is a good model for a similar trait to reflect a magical, celestial heritage, replacing the tiefling’s spells with spells of similar levels that more closely match the aasimar’s celestial ancestry. However, the aasimar’s expanded resistance might require limiting this trait to basic utility spells. Filling in the remaining details, we end up with the following racial traits for the aasimar: Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Aasimar mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer. Alignment. Due to their celestial heritage, aasimar are often good. However, some aasimar fall into evil, rejecting their heritage. Size. Aasimar are built like well-proportioned humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to your celestial heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Celestial Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage. Celestial Legacy. You know the light cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the lesser restoration spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the daylight spell once with this trait as a 3rd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Dungeon Master's Guide"},{"name":"Aasimar","description":"I saw her, wreathed in wings of pure light, her eyes blazing with the fury of the gods. The bone devils stopped in their tracks, shielding their faces. Her blade, now a brand of light, swept once, twice, three times. The devils’ heads hit the ground, one after another. And thus we learned that an aasimar traveled in our ragtag band. —Geldon Parl, Of the Tyranny of Dragons Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens. They are descended from humans with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage. Celestial Champions Aasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their patrons expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice. From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness. Each aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world. Hidden Wanderers While aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically prefer to keep a low profile. An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial champion if they had the chance. When traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities. They nevertheless have no compunction about striking openly at evil. The secrecy they desire is never worth endangering the innocent. Aasimar Guides An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being—usually a deva—provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings. The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about. As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character’s angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character’s guide. Angelic Guide d6 Name 1 Tadriel 2 Myllandra 3 Seraphina 4 Galladia 5 Mykiel 6 Valandras d6 Nature 1 Bookish and lecturing 2 Compassionate and hopeful 3 Practical and lighthearted 4 Fierce and vengeful 5 Stern and judgmental 6 Kind and parental Note to the DM: Playing an Angelic Guide As DM, you take on the role of an aasimar’s angelic guide and decide what kind of advice or omens to send in dreams. The deva, or other celestial being, is your chance to add special roleplaying opportunities to the game. Remember, a deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva might not understand the compromises and hard choices that mortals must grapple with in the world. To the deva, an aasimar is a prized student who must live up to high, sometimes inflexible standards. Conflicted Souls Despite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing. Evil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them. Even aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar’s guide is wise but not infallible. Aasimar Names Most aasimar are born from human parents, and they use the same naming conventions as their native culture. Aasimar Traits Your aasimar character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Aasimar mature at the same rate as humans, but they can live up to 160 years. Size. Aasimar have the same range of height and weight as humans. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Blessed with a radiant soul, your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Celestial Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage. Healing Hands. As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level.

You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial. Subrace. Three subraces of aasimar exist: protector aasimar, scourge aasimar, and fallen aasimar. Choose one of them for your character. Random Height and Weight You may roll for your character’s height and weight. The roll in the Height Modifier column adds a number (in inches) to the character’s base height. To get a weight, multiply the number you rolled for height by the roll in the Weight Modifier column and add the result (in pounds) to the base weight. Base Height Base Weight Height Modifier Weight Modifier 4'8\" 110 lb. +2d10 × (2d4) lb. Protector Aasimar Protector aasimar are charged by the powers of good to guard the weak, to strike at evil wherever it arises, and to stand vigilant against the darkness. From a young age, a protector aasimar receives advice and directives that urge to stand against evil. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Radiant Soul. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to glimmer and two luminous, incorporeal wings to sprout from your back. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you have a flying speed of 30 feet, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Scourge Aasimar Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil—a desire that is, at its best, unflinching and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourge aasimar wear masks to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1. Radiant Consumption. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing a searing light to radiate from you, pour out of your eyes and mouth, and threaten to char you. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within 10 feet of you take radiant damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Fallen Aasimar An aasimar who was touched by dark powers as a youth or who turns to evil in early adulthood can become one of the fallen—a group of aasimar whose inner light has been replaced by shadow. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1. Necrotic Shroud. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and two skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant you transform, other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see you must each succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra necrotic damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Falling from Grace or Rising to It With your DM’s consent, you can change your character’s subrace to fallen aasimar if your protector/scourge aasimar turns to evil. To do so, replace your subrace benefits, including the ability score increase, with those of a fallen aasimar. Similarly, if your fallen aasimar turns to good, your DM might allow you to become a protector or scourge aasimar.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Volo's Guide to Monsters"},{"name":"Aasimar","description":"Whether descended from a celestial being or infused with heavenly power, aasimar are mortals who carry a spark of the Upper Planes within their souls.

Aasimar are the purest expression of that divine light as it burns within every mortal soul, for the souls of those blessed with an angelic ancestor blaze brighter than any other. Even rarer than the tieflings with whom they share a commonality of ancestry, aasimar are mortal, and yet are understood to be destined for a grander cosmic purpose than others around them. In every culture across the continent of Wildemount, the birth of an aasimar is seen as a blessing and a portent. Aasimar who can bear the burden of their destiny become champions of noble causes, and encourage others to walk always in the light. More often than not, however, an aasimar saddled with a vague destiny and the grand aspirations of their clan ultimately falls from grace, their inner light succumbing to shadow. Aasimar in the Dwendalian Empire To a law-abiding family worshiping state-approved gods, the birth of an aasimar child is nothing short of a miracle. Such a child is not only promised a charmed life, but elevates the social status of their family. However, to a family that secretly worships gods outlawed by the empire, the birth of a child touched by an angel of such deities is a mixed blessing. If the event draws the scrutiny of a settlement’s idolmaster and their cronies, it might force family members to flee their homes for the Greying Wildlands or the Menagerie Coast. Aasimar on the Menagerie Coast In the Clovis Concord, the cosmopolitan melting pot of Wildemount, most folk are inured to the sight of unusual and remarkable people. Even so, aasimar are a sight to behold, and there are many who don’t mind being rude if it means spending a few extra seconds staring at a radiant aasimar as they pass by. Aasimar in Xhorhas Those in the Kryn Dynasty who study dunamancy see aasimar as brimming with near-limitless potential. As such, aasimar are often sought out from birth to be trained as dunamancers and echo knights. The tribesfolk who wander Xhorhas see the birth of an aasimar as a message from the gods, and their shamans ascribe meaning to that birth by the conditions of the world. An aasimar born during a raging storm might be a word of warning from Kord the Storm Lord, whereas an aasimar whose mother gave birth in a field of flowers could be a vow of protection from Melora the Wild Mother. Aasimar Guides An aasimar, except for one who has turned evil, has a link to an angelic being.

Aasimar are the purest expression of that divine light as it burns within every mortal soul, for the souls of those blessed with an angelic ancestor blaze brighter than any other. Even rarer than the tieflings with whom they share a commonality of ancestry, aasimar are mortal, and yet are understood to be destined for a grander cosmic purpose than others around them. In every culture across the continent of Wildemount, the birth of an aasimar is seen as a blessing and a portent. Aasimar who can bear the burden of their destiny become champions of noble causes, and encourage others to walk always in the light. More often than not, however, an aasimar saddled with a vague destiny and the grand aspirations of their clan ultimately falls from grace, their inner light succumbing to shadow. Aasimar in the Dwendalian Empire To a law-abiding family worshiping state-approved gods, the birth of an aasimar child is nothing short of a miracle. Such a child is not only promised a charmed life, but elevates the social status of their family. However, to a family that secretly worships gods outlawed by the empire, the birth of a child touched by an angel of such deities is a mixed blessing. If the event draws the scrutiny of a settlement’s idolmaster and their cronies, it might force family members to flee their homes for the Greying Wildlands or the Menagerie Coast. Aasimar on the Menagerie Coast In the Clovis Concord, the cosmopolitan melting pot of Wildemount, most folk are inured to the sight of unusual and remarkable people. Even so, aasimar are a sight to behold, and there are many who don’t mind being rude if it means spending a few extra seconds staring at a radiant aasimar as they pass by. Aasimar in Xhorhas Those in the Kryn Dynasty who study dunamancy see aasimar as brimming with near-limitless potential. As such, aasimar are often sought out from birth to be trained as dunamancers and echo knights. The tribesfolk who wander Xhorhas see the birth of an aasimar as a message from the gods, and their shamans ascribe meaning to that birth by the conditions of the world. An aasimar born during a raging storm might be a word of warning from Kord the Storm Lord, whereas an aasimar whose mother gave birth in a field of flowers could be a vow of protection from Melora the Wild Mother. Aasimar Guides An aasimar, except for one who has turned evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being—usually a deva—provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings. The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about. As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character’s angelic guide. The Angelic Guide and Angelic Nature tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character’s guide.

They use the same naming conventions as their native culture. Aasimar Traits An aasimar character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Aasimar mature at the same rate as humans, but they can live up to 160 years. Alignment. Imbued with celestial power, most aasimar are good. Outcast aasimar are most often neutral or even evil. Size. Aasimar have the same range of height and weight as humans. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier: Size modifier = 2d10 Height = 4 feet + 8 inches + your size modifier in inches Weight in pounds = 110 + (2d4 × your size modifier) Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Blessed with a radiant soul, your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Celestial Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage. Healing Hands. As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Light Bearer. You know the light cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial. Subrace. Three subraces for aasimar exist: protector aasimar, scourge aasimar, and fallen aasimar. Choose one of them for your character. Protector Aasimar Protector aasimar are charged by the powers of good to protect the weak, to strike at evil wherever it arises, and to stand vigilant against the darkness. From a young age, a protector aasimar receives advice and directives that urge them to stand against evil. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Radiant Soul. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to glimmer and two luminous, incorporeal wings to sprout from your back. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you have a flying speed of 30 feet, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Scourge Aasimar Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil—a desire that is, at its best, unflinching and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourge aasimar wear masks to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1. Radiant Consumption. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing a searing light to radiate from you, pouring out of your eyes and mouth, and threaten to char you. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within 10 feet of you take radiant damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Fallen Aasimar An aasimar who was touched by dark powers as a youth or who turns evil in early adulthood can become one of the fallen—a group of aasimar whose inner light has been replaced by shadow. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1. Necrotic Shroud. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and two skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant you transform, other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see you must each succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra necrotic damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Explorer's Guide to Wildemount (deprecated)"},{"name":"Accursed Tiefling","description":"The city of Luyarnha has never experienced the threat of devils, as if fiends fear coming near the city walls. This absence extends to those of infernal descent; tieflings born in the gothic city are severed from their devilish origins, their blood becoming tied to something far more sinister. Called “accursed” due to their monstrous appearance, they are feared by most, and their powers envied by nearly as many, letting their jealousy morph into hatred; an accursed existence indeed. These tieflings possess a fraction of the power of their dark mother’s boundless reproduction and are incapable of creating life, though they can create figments of it, with the most powerful capable of creating ephemeral copies of themselves to fight in battle. These tieflings never stay in the city for long, vanishing shortly after reaching adulthood. Accursed Tiefling Features Appearance. Accursed tieflings vastly differ from their brethren. Instead of a pair of horns, they have dozens protruding from their skull, akin to a never-ending cancerous growth. Their monstrous shape is furthered by the eye-like protrusions that cover the horns, although they are nothing more than bony sprouts waiting to burgeon. Their skin is thick, covered in bestial fur, and their muscular limbs are grossly misshaped; the human half of their heritage has nearly all but vanished. Ability Score Increase.

Child of the Black Goat. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Darkvision. Thanks to your eldritch heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Eldritch Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic damage. Legacy of a Thousand Young. You know the spare the dying cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the false life spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the mirror image spell once with this trait. You regain the ability to cast these spells with this trait when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Call of the Brood. If a Blood Moon is out while you are asleep, you have a dream (as per the spell, save DC 16). In this dream, the Black Goat places a compulsion within your mind, ordering you to carry out some activity as a torrent of images and sensations. When you awaken, you are automatically affected by a suggestion spell (save DC 16, cast as a 7th-level spell) in addition to the effects of dream, and must carry out the order.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"MonkeyDM","book":"Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt"},{"name":"Air Genasi","description":"Genasi Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements.

Aldani vary in colour, red Aldani are common in Chult, and blue in the Trackless Sea. Aldani are peaceful yet xenophobic. The aldani of Chult live almost exclusively in the Aldani Basin, where they stay in seclusion from the surrounding sentient races. The lobsterfolk of the Trackless Sea are often found in monasteries in the pursuit of inner peace. Aldani Names Aldani take names similar to the local humans. Their primary language is Common, thus taking human names is easy for them. Despite this, lobsterfolk can communicate through a second language, a series of clacks and snaps produced by their pincers. An individual aldani might have a series of sounds it uses instead. Aldani care little for family lines, nor do they make any distinction between genders or sexes, thus all aldani use a single, unisex name.

The amoeboid’s nucleus flashed dark red, his version of a resigned sigh. Standing in the medical bay of his saucer, he watched a pair of automatons clean viscera off the walls and ceiling. \"The serum made no difference; those cows were just like the last batch,\" said Yr, making a gesture like stroking his chin. He made his way to the next room, where a terrified human man lay restrained on a table, yelling incoherently. He touched the man and his shape changed, taking on more human-like proportions, but with a grossly overlarge head and bulging eyes. \"Sorry for the inconvenience,\" Yr apologized in the man’s language. \"I wish I could repay you for your livestock, but we have rules against that sort of thing, I’m afraid. Now please stop squirming while I ready a memory modification.\" — Yr, amoeboid scientist, assessing a Void experiment Amoeboids are intelligent, vaguely humanoid-shaped, translucent oozes that can mimic the form of any creature they touch. These creatures tend to the maw stations, experimenting into the nature of space and time, parlaying with any creature they meet. Fluid Anatomy Amoeboid bodies are almost entirely composed of a translucent jelly-like substance, with a complex network of nerves visible throughout, which emit a dim blue light. Within their heads, a large, brain-like nucleus floats, surrounded by five eyespots spaced radially around it. Their fluid bodies can take the genetic imprint of creatures they touch, molding into an inexact copy, visibly made of the same jelly material. When in this form, however, amoeboids can speak the language of their copy and move in much the same way, allowing them to empathize with virtually any creature. No one is sure exactly how the bizarre anatomy of the amoeboids came to be, for they are among the oldest races in the 'verse and few accounts exist before them. The elves believe that their strange forms were created on a rogue world, flung into the Black by a catastrophic event, but the avia-ra maintain that their forms are a result of long-term corruption by the Void. There might be some credence to this latter theory, for those that are exposed to the Void's terrible lights and survive undergo the warp and are changed in drastic and horrifying ways, being robbed forever of their previous forms. Perhaps, it is possible that the amoeboids were warped so intensely they were left as mere genetic sludge, lacking any true shape. Scientists and Mawkeepers Above all else, amoeboids value logical thinking as a lens to analyze the world. They keenly believe that the multiverse is founded on an objective, concrete reality defined solely by magic and physics, all of which can be understood. All things, including the elusive mystery of the maw stations, can be unraveled with proper attention, experimentation, and reasoning. Most amoeboids regard no subject as taboo and have few qualms about any kind of research, as long as its methodology is sound and is reasonably likely to produce useful data. Most amoeboids live on the maw stations themselves, researching the maw's activities, repairing ships and Dark Matter engines, and trading information with other scientists and wizards the 'verse over. With their keen intellect, amoeboids make excellent alchemists, gadgeteers, and wizards, and can find no better place to live than the maw stations. Strange Visitors Amoeboids have taken to visiting settled worlds in secret, disguising their saucers and themselves to perform experiments on the inhabitants. By and large, these experiments are noninvasive, but are nonetheless unwelcome. As a result, many worlds have ancient tales of strange visitors from the stars, looking much like them, but strangely distorted, who steal individuals away by night and subject them to strange rituals in brightly lit rooms. Amoeboids will also vivisect the odd head of livestock, but these occurrences are more likely to be blamed on predators than on men from the stars. Amoeboid Names Ever concerned with efficiency, amoeboid names can traditionally be represented by a single unusual character, to differentiate it from the rest of a particular alphabet. Amoeboids don't differentiate between males and females, nor are their names particularly masculine or feminine. Amoeboid Names: Ash (Æ), Chevron (Λ), Digamma (Ͷ), Eth (Ð), Ezh (Ʒ), Gangia (Ϫ), Kai (ϗ), Pilcrow (¶), Psi (Ψ), Shei (Ϣ), Solidus (/), Thorn (Þ), Tilde (~), Yr (Ʀ) Amoeboid Traits As an amoeboid, your bizarre anatomy grants you the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age. Amoeboids swiftly reach maturity, growing to full size in a mere 3 years, and have especially long lifespans, living as long as 200 to 300 years. Alignment. Natural-born scientists, amoeboids tend to be skeptical and deductive. They lean toward neutral alignments. Size. Amoeboids have a roughly similar mass to other humanoid creatures and stand 4 to 5 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Flexible Form. You can use your action to stretch, compress, and mold your body into a myriad of shapes. You can transform into any static form that you choose that is no larger than 8 feet in any dimension. When you assume this form, you can replicate something’s basic shape but not its color, texture, moving parts, or fine details. You can’t change your body’s volume, nor can you move, attack, or cast spells while you’re transformed into a static shape. You can also use your action to touch a living creature and assume its general form. Your size and other statistics don’t change. You gain the ability to speak and understand that creature’s language, and if the target has a burrowing, climbing, or swimming speed, you gain those with the same speed, up to a maximum of 40 feet. Your transformation ends after 1 hour, or when you choose to end it on your turn (no action required). If you transform into a form incapable of wearing armor, your armor falls off. You can only take actions while you’re transformed if you are in the form of a creature, and you can only take actions that creature would be able to take. Amorphous. You can compress your body enough to squeeze through a 1-inch wide space. You can't expand inside a space that offers any resistance. Reform. Whenever you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a nonmagical weapon and don't drop to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to immediately regain 1d4 hit points, up to a maximum of the amount of damage taken. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Amoeboid. Most creatures are only able to approximate speaking Amoeboid, for its burbling words are made using the amoeboid’s fluid body. If you are transformed into a creature that has a language, you can speak and understand that language.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Mage Hand Press","book":"Dark Matter Starter Kit"},{"name":"Animal Yokai","description":"Yōkai is a term that covers countless different supernatural beings of Rokugan, from wayfaring fox spirits who guide (or deceive) lost travelers to carnivorous umbrellas, and everything in between. The yōkai broadly termed “animal yōkai” tend to take the form of sentient animals with paranormal abilities. Folk belief in Rokugan holds that when animals reach a certain age, or encounter a certain natural phenomena, they become yōkai. In contrast, Rokugani scholars attest that animal yōkai originate from the Realm of Animals in the “enchanted country” of Senkyō, where they serve the competing courts of Chikushudō and Sakkaku. When asked directly, animal yōkai have been known to confirm both of these accounts, neither, or spin more spectacular origins still. Animal yōkai generally possess a true animal form and a human guise, and have powers that humans find strange and difficult to understand. Yōkai and Humans From the point of view of a human, animal yōkai are believed to be friendly as often they are to be malicious or purely indifferent to human struggles. Animals such as foxes (kitsune) and river otters (kawauso) are known to bewitch and play tricks on unwitting travelers, but also to come to the aid of the lost or desperate. Bat spirits (kōmori), on the other hand, are viewed by many people in Rokugan as good omens and helpful guides. Of course, individual yōkai have their own agendas and views of humans. Some actively try to hinder those they interpret as invaders in the wilds of Rokugan, while others may simply be curious and wish to observe human behavior. A yōkai’s player is free to determine their particular motives, which might be ideological or whimsical, petty or profound. Yōkai Taxonomy Rokugani scholars have attempted to classify wild yōkai throughout the years, but as befitting such unpredictable beings, they tend to defy classification. What even qualifies as a “yōkai” is a matter of debate among folklorists, philosophers, and scholars. One school of thought divides yōkai by their origins, sorting them between “Transformed Beings,” “Nature Beings,” and “Tricksters” hailing from the Realm of Animals. Another classification categorizes yōkai by their specific habitat or element. Yōkai themselves rarely bother with such distinctions; the need to endlessly compartmentalize and classify is a human trait, and not one most yōkai share. Animal Yōkai Traits As a animal yōkai, you benefit from the following: Ability Score Increase . Choose one ability score to increase by 2, and another to increase by 1. Age . Yōkai are generally considered mature in their late teens, though the different passage of time in various spiritual realms can mean that this appears to happen much more quickly or slowly from the perspective of someone in the Mortal Realm. Yōkai can live hundreds or potentially thousands of years. Size . Your size varies based on the form you take. See Innate Shapeshifting . Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Innate Shapeshifting . You have two forms: your mortal form and your yōkai form. After you complete a short rest, you can switch between these forms. Your mortal form appears to be human (or, with the GM’s permission, another species of your choice) in all anatomical ways, save for the occasional tail poking out from a robe that quickly vanishes when inspected more closely. In mortal form, your size is that of the species you chose. Your yōkai form is determined by your lineage: choose bat (kōmori), fox (kitsune), or otter (kawauso), below. When you transform into your yōkai form, you can choose for any or all of your items to be safely stored within Senkyō, returning to you when you change back into your mortal form.

But it was not for any sort of empathy nor any grand sense of purpose. We were desperate, and through such desperation we could not see that we were doing what we, as a people, would never think of doing to ourselves. By the time we realized what we had done, it was too late to go back. So, in the end, instead of taking credit for giving them life, we took pride in giving them their lives back.” — Halfath Ganric, dendus scholar Given life with no soul, but imbued with purpose, the ashenforged are one of the greatest achievements since the discovery of the Crucibles. Though no longer the war-bred union they once were, they have instead become a symbol of advancement to their creators and representatives of a larger purpose. Enigmas of Science During the initial experiments within the cores of the Crucibles, the dendus discovered the ability to imbue artificial intelligence into a physical form. The brains, and sometimes the organs and parts of the deceased were placed into a bio-engineered shell, then modified with sorium melding using an ash-colored substance that collects on the crucible’s surface. The resulting forms were mostly humanoid, but also carried various minor physical traits depending on the lifeform’s former appearance. Though the dendus could have created completely artificial forms, using the brains and fragments of the deceased, along with a biological form, provided them with two unique advantages. First, even without the specific memories of their past, an ashenforged adapts quickly, able to recall small parts of its former self as if it were muscle memory. The second, more interesting discovery, is that they are able to attune themselves to sorium and achieve Esper Genesis, the power to wield and manipulate the forces of creation. The dendus do not truly know why this is the case but they do hold multiple theories, often argued within their circles. Physically, though mostly humanoid, ashenforged carry some of the minor physical traits of their former selves. This could be anything from pointed/ridged ears, small tails, or elongated fingers. All ashenforged have the same grayish metallic colored skin with eyes that range between metallic blues and purples. Forged In War During the decade long Nesieve Conflict, the dendus allied with the eldori to prevent their destruction at the hands of the ruthless lorendi invasion. The ashenforged were created for the purpose of defense against overwhelming odds. After the end of the conflict, the dendus decided to continue their work, creating ashenforged that would serve as emissaries, workers, guards, and explorers. As a race of former slaves, the dendus do not believe in forced servitude. Each ashenforged is given a basic purpose from which they decide their own path. Galactic Pioneers Though a majority of the ashenforged have established communities on Dendusar, a great many of them have ventured out to find their own paths. They can be found anywhere in the Silrayne Arc or even beyond, attempting to integrate themselves into multiple aspects of society, which they think is the best way to develop as a species. Most ashenforged can be found on populated planets as craftsmen, mechanics, or artisans. Those who stuck to their roots in war can be found as mercenaries and bodyguards. Most have established clans based off of the origins of their parentage. Each one bears markings on their skin that the indicate the scientist or engineering guild from which their clan was created. Some form unions and create offspring with the help of the dendus. The new generation can then be marked in the same manner of the clan, or they can even bear marks of a union of two clans. Historically, this is why many ashenforged surnames tend to be very similar to those of the dendus. Ashenforged Names When ashenforged are created, they are given a given an identification number. Upon reaching maturity, they are given a name that signifies either the scientific guild which created them or the dendus facility in which they trained, the latter of which is usually a factory, lab, or upon a Crucible. Their surname is always the clan name of the eldest parent. The ashenforged have no gender distinction when it comes to their names. Many ashenforged keep their given names, while there are those that make alterations to one more to their liking, or change it completely to something more befitting of their nature. Sample Names: Armus, Botarva, Corrus, Deltrivas, Exharlian, Hullvan, Lunarion, Medisi, Primis, Securali, Solus, Sonarvi, Stellivan, Tielvin, Turmirion Clan Names: Aelar, Bartuvo, Duadan, Ganros, Kolrom, Maraval, Nystim, Shanralim, Tyngor, Verkast Ashenforged Traits As an ashenforged, you are gifted with a number of traits that are imbued within you upon creation. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age. Ashenforged mentally mature within the first five years. Most often live another 40-50 years before their body decays. Alignment. Most ashenforged are lawful, raised with their chosen path and purpose being priority above most other things. Size. An ashenforged’s height can vary, usually between 6 feet to 7.5 feet. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. As an ashenforged, you are gifted with the ability to see well in dim and dark places. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were in dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease and you are resistant to poison damage. Artisan Training. You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice from the following list: cybersmith’s tools, shipwright’s tools, cooking supplies, tailoring supplies. Languages. You speak, read, and write Common, Dendusi, and one other language of your choice. Ashenforged often tend to quickly learn the language of their former self. Sub-type. The ashenforged are divided between two primary types. Choose one of these.

As the world Virthys was torn apart by a mad dragon god, flames erupted from the core of the world as it broke apart. Blazing fire turned the land of Dvarys into ash and coal, and those who weren’t consumed by the flames were buried as the land itself collapsed. Before all that, Dvarys was a highly advanced republic. Driven by the search for knowledge and the desire to better people's lives, it was a culture of sages, inventors, philosophers and artists. It was probably as close to a utopia as you can realistically get. When the apocalypse struck and Virthys was destroyed, the chosen champion of Ashandri Marisha Veilbreaker tried to save Dvarys. But she was too late, and the land she rescued was burnt to ashes. Millions were already dying as the world-creating magic pulled Dvarys towards what should become Ashandri. Despite the countless deaths, for some there was still hope. The champion’s magic transformed them moments before certain doom. Instead of burning or suffocating, buried in the ashes of the world, these survivors merged with fire and ash. They became that which tried to kill them. Their skin turned dark and cracked, and they grew raven-like feathers created out of the very ash that surrounded them. This plumage not only served as protection in the deadly environment, but also allowed them to swim through the ashen remains of Dvarys. The smaller the person, the better they can willingly move these feathers. Those Ashfolk that originally belonged to a small-sized race can use their feathers to move faster: When they walk, it looks as if wind blows through the ashen plumes. This gives them a push when walking, allowing them to catch up with the bigger-sized members of their race. The metamorphosis also changed their lungs, allowing them to breathe ash and smoke. And as if to constantly remind them how closely they escaped death, their faces are light grey, sometimes even white, like the colour of bones. Together with the large dark circles around their eyes and black streaks around their lips, mirroring the teeth, their faces look a bit like skulls. All the changes the Ashfolk have gone through were still not enough for some members of the new race to survive. But whatever perilous situation they were in, the Ashfolk had extraordinary luck, managing to cheat death where others would have died. Some Ashfolk believe their face patterns aren't just a reminder, but a physical expression of this peculiar ability. They had been humans, elves, gnomes, dwarves and halflings before. Instead of finding certain death, they transformed, and the Ashfolk emerged from the remains of Dvarys. Now they were the firstborn of the Ocean of Ash. Culture Most Ashfolk have been residents of the utopian land of Dvarys, and only a few of them were visitors and travellers. Their homes and belongings destroyed, these survivors had almost nothing left but their very lives - in a way, not even their former identities. This feeling of absolute loss unites the Ashfolk. Many of them are dark and brooding, but also very sympathetic to the suffering of others. And there's another side to them. They lived in a nation of peace and safety, of bright minds and great art. Most Ashfolk have grown into strong, self-confident personalities. They are not just survivors - they have seen what the world can be like, and they're here to build a new society from the ashes of the old. Due to their physical appearance, they have met a lot of rejection and prejudice. Being seen as evil, or even as monstrous undead (even though they are very much alive), made them cautious. Many Ashfolk prefer to keep to their own communities, at least until they are met with less intolerance. If you treat them with respect, though, you usually receive the same thing. After Dvarys had become the Ocean of Ash, about half of the Ashfolk left their former home behind. Most of them stayed in Delvaroth after crossing the border to this region, but a few spread out all over the new world. Some simply wanted to explore, others ran away from the memories of what they had lost in their old home. Those who stayed live in a grim environment, but they aren't willing to give up. No matter how many generations it will take, they want to bring Dvarys back to its former glory. Many of them live together with other survivors, people that evaded death without being transformed, and the Ashfolk often take over crucial roles in their communities. Names Some Ashfolk still carry their old names, but many decided to embrace their new identities and have given themselves new names. Their physiology makes it easier to pronounce soft sounds, and the names (and their entire tone of voice) usually reflect that. Most Ashfolk names are short, but a few individuals have names with four or even five syllables. Curiously, other members of the race can always hear the emotion or meaning that an Ashfolk name is supposed to represent. Different names can mean the same thing, and sometimes a slightly different pronunciation of the same word can give it a completely different meaning. This intuitive understanding only comes up with Ashfolk names, and strangely doesn't work with names or even regular words from the languages of other races. Some sages predict that this \"racial talent\" might lead to a new language for the Ashfolk in the long run. Some examples for typical Ashfolk names and their associated meanings are shown in the following list. They can be used for both male and female Ashfolk. All names are pronounced without any breaks, flowing smoothly and calmly. Vuley: Beauty Abath: Clarity Sherendan: Warrior or Survivor Maeon: Creation Imiri: Sweet , Cute Alima: Magical , Enchanted or Powerful Gavaa: Patient or Intelligent Emios: Riddle or Mysterious Huvalari: Noble or Great Lai: Efficient or Short , also Short-Tempered Simia: Ice , Cold or Cruel Thami: Fire or Anger Anatomy The Ashfolk have been part of a variety of humanoid races before they were transformed: Humans, elves, halflings, dwarves and gnomes. They kept their general physical build, making them a very diverse species. On most of their body, their skin is dark ash. It doesn't just look like that - it is literal ash. The only exception to the dark shades are their faces, which show grey or white skin patterns roughly resembling the person's skull shape. Because of that, Ashfolk are sometimes mistaken for undead. Their eyes have either a black, white or strikingly yellow colour. Instead of hair, they grow raven-like feathers of ash, going all the way down to their backs and arms, sometimes also covering the legs. Their front is usually free of these feathers. The ashen plumage looks less like wings than like a black, feathery coat. These feathers allow them to swim through ash. A few rare members of the race also have deep, smoldering cracks in their skin, burning or gleaming with ember. They physically feel the heat, but without pain, and some Ashfolk call these cracks \"burning freckles\". Ashfolk have pitch black blood, and they cannot cry tears. Traits Ability Score Increase: Constitution+2, Dexterity+1 Age: Ashfolk are such a young and diverse race that it's hard to tell how old they can become. Children and adolescents grow at a speed similar to humans, and they mature at about 20 years. After that, aging did not affect them very much in the first years of Ashandri. Sages believe they have adapted the life span of the oldest of their original races, the elves, which would allow them to live for about 700 years. Alignment: As former residents of Dvarys, the Ashfolk tend toward good alignments. In general, they have more or less the same life philosophies they had before the apocalypse. The extreme experiences have pushed a part of them in a different direction, though - sometimes for the better, sometimes for worse. Lineage and size: Ashfolk have the same build they had before the metamorphosis, which makes them a widely varied species. Your size is either Medium or Small. You do not have any of the abilities or features of your original species. Languages: Most Ashfolk are well educated. They can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of their choice. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and in ash, you have a Swimming speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Ashfolk can see in dim light within 30 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Fire Resistance: You have Resistance to fire damage. Ashborn: You can breathe ash, smoke and air, and you can swim through ash. You only eat ash and coal. To nourish yourself, you can burn whatever flammable material is available (including inorganic matter), and consume it once it's fully burnt. You do not need to drink (but you can). Relentless Endurance: When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest. Cheat Death: You make every death saving throw with advantage. Once per day, if you failed any kind of saving throw, you can decide to roll again.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Astral Elf","description":"Long ago, groups of elves ventured from the Feywild to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. Life in the Silver Void has imbued their souls with a spark of divine light. That light manifests as a starry gleam in an astral elf’s eyes. Because nothing ages on the Astral Plane, astral elves who inhabit that plane can be very old, and their longevity gives them an unusual perspective on the passage of time. Some are prone to melancholy, while others might display an absence of feeling. Many look for creative ways to occupy themselves. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see things through the lens of time as having little or no meaning to them. Astral elves who don’t dwell on the Astral Plane can live to be more than 750 years old. Astral Elf Traits As an astral elf player character, you have the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf. Size. You are Medium. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Astral Fire.

You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you remain conscious. Whenever you finish this trance, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice and with one weapon or tool of your choice, selected from the Player’s Handbook.

Your consciousness was once a string of thoughts and desires lost within the aether’s vastness. Then, your peaceful existence as thought alone was disturbed when a body crashed into the aether. This body was torn, broken, and dying—or dead already. Your essence surged into this shattered vessel, and you willed the aether to heal its flaws. Not long after, you emerged from the waves and marveled at your new, physical form. It was a body, one that had limbs, senses, and lifeblood: things you could only dream of as a flickering, aetherial thought. The body you emerged from the astral waves with was once rent asunder but is now healed; the former wounds glowing with the light of stars and nebulae. Your features resemble those of the creature who died beneath the aetherial waves, but your thoughts and feelings are wholly new, fashioned from the collective consciousness of the cosmos. Astral Emergent Base Traits All astral emergent characters have the following traits: Age. Astral emergents age at the same rate as members of their vessel’s species. You likely inherited the body of an adult seafarer lost to the aetherial waves. You recall hazy echoes of that person’s memories, including how to speak, move, eat, and any other functions a humanoid needs to survive. Creature Type.

Your Constitution score increases by 1, and two other ability scores of your choice also increase by 1. Variant: Resurrecting Astral Emergents Most astral emergents are content to explore the Aetherial Expanse from a new, humanoid perspective for a time, and then simply return to the aether to resume their unity with the sea. However, an astral emergent with a strong, individual identity or a strong sense of purpose, such as a player character, can be called back from the sea after death. To resurrect such an emergent, a new body must be found. This body can be a deceased organic creature’s, or magically constructed from a material like clay, stone, or iron at the GM’s discretion. Once a body is procured, the individual spirit must first be contacted with a speak with dead spell, then a raise dead or a resurrection spell must be cast while the body is lowered into the aether. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. If your vessel had other movement options, such as a flying speed, those limbs no longer function to provide that form of movement. Aetheric Adaptation. You are immune to the effects of aether poisoning page 20 -->. Formed of Aether. The Aetherial Expanse wishes to reclaim your body. You take 1d4 force damage when you touch aether for the first time on a turn or start your turn in contact with it. While fully immersed in aether, as an action at the start of each of your turns, you can make a DC 13 Charisma check to fight against the aether and reverse the process. On a success, you gain 1d8 temporary hit points instead of taking the force damage. One with the Sea. When you die, you can’t be resurrected except by a wish spell. Your form melts away as your body and mind return to the Aetherial Expanse. A creature that casts speak with dead while touching the aether must make a successful DC 21 Charisma (Investigation) check to discern your mind from among the flickering egos within the sea. Unusual Nature. You don’t require air, food, or drink. When you sleep or fall unconscious, your form flickers and wavers, becoming translucent and revealing the constellation of lights that make up your bones.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":32048},"publisher":"Ghostfire Gaming","book":"Aetherial Expanse Setting Guide"},{"name":"Astral Merfolk","description":"Astral Merfolk The merfolk of the Aetherial Expanse make their home in the Constellation Isles, where they’re locked in eternal enmity with their age-old foes, the astral merrow. The merfolk of the Constellation Isles tell tales of tumbling into this world of eternal, starlit twilight long ago. And though many of their kind died—or worse, mutated into merrow—over time, they became at home in the aether. The magic of the Aetherial Expanse has made their skin bright with shining colors, giving them the uncommon ability to shapechange their long tail fins into legs with webbed feet, which allow them to walk comfortably on land. Though astral merfolk are most at home in the aether and try to steer clear of the greed of land dwellers, the allure of those who walk on land and sail on wooden ships often proves too great to resist. The astral merfolk have built a society in the Constellation Isles around the isle of Larmeath. They try to live a peaceful life despite the constant predation of their fallen kin, the merrow. Nevertheless, some merfolk dream of more than a placid life in Larmeath disrupted by vicious merrow attacks.

Though superficially an automaton resembles a human, having the same general physical characteristics, the perfection of its form is a clue to their its nature. Its facial features are just a bit too symmetrical, its skin too unblemished, its body shape just a shade too robotic. Inside, their muscles, bones and organs resemble those of typical humans, but an artificially created crimson liquid flows through their veins instead of blood. HUMANLIKE BUT NOT HUMAN Automatons have the same build as most humans, with no size difference in height or weight between males and females. Because they move with mechanical precision, automatons appear slightly odd to members of many other races. Automatons’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and includes metallic shades such as silver and zirconium. Their hair and eyes can be of any hue, including white. GROWN, NOT BORN Virtually every automaton came into being in wasteland ruins or some other forgotten place in the world. Unlike most other races, automatons are not born, nor are they built as a construct is. Each one is grown in a pod filled with nutrient-rich fluids and enzymes designed to accelerate its maturation until it reaches the age programmed into its pod and is ready to be released. This process can take as little as a few weeks or as long as a year. A pod that contains an ungrown automaton embryo remains functional for centuries or longer until the pod initiates the growth process. Once it produces an automaton, a pod becomes nonfunctional. These dormant pods might be found languishing in a crumbling technological ruin (possibly the remains of a starship, an ancient culture, or a trans-dimensional colony) until a pod completes the growth process and a new automaton stumbles out into the world. BLANK SLATES Automatons emerge from their pods with no knowledge of who or what they are or how they came to be. Obeying a subconscious directive from its pod, an automaton ventures away from its birthplace as quickly as possible. Its first days of independent life are spent in a barely sentient haze while the automaton’s mind struggles to adapt to its new environment. Many automatons fall prey to monsters or other hazards during this time. Those who survive experience a moment they call the “Awakening” approximately five days after their emergence from their pods. They abruptly become clear-headed and self-aware, ready to make decisions about how to spend their lives. Some automatons have an insatiable curiosity about every aspect of existence, often venturing far and wide in search of new experiences. Others become fixated on a particular subject and devote all their time to increase their knowledge or aptitude in their chosen obsession. DREAMS OF BEFORE During a long rest, automatons have a 5% chance of dreaming about the culture or race who created them. These dreams could be remnants of the programming infused into the automatons during their maturation in their growth pods, forgotten directives from a long dead race, or messages sent from other stars or dimensions. The automatons themselves do not know the truth behind the dreams and generally chalk them up to yet another oddity of their existence. However, there are some automatons who call themselves “Seekers” who actively try to follow these dreams. Though many of their searches are fruitless, following the dreams has led some seekers to lost technological ruins in the wastelands, so perhaps there is something more to these visions. AUTOMATON NAMES When an automaton becomes self-aware after emerging from its pod, it realizes it needs a name to identify itself. Most automatons adopt names used by the first race or culture they encounter after their Awakening. Some take a more imaginative approach, inventing monikers that reflect how they perceive themselves, or they choose names derived from the strange dreams they sometimes experience. Due to some quirk of their minds, once an automaton takes a name, they never change it. This has sometimes led to odd name choices as newly awakened automatons don’t understand the cultures and societies they find themselves in. Some automatons are content with a single name, while others prefer to have both a name and a family name. Little distinction exists between male, female, object, and family names; the order of things depends on the preference of the automaton. Male Automaton Names: Bob, Erdan, Merric, Pouch, Rhogar, Seebo, Sold, Thokk, Unit Zero-One Female Automaton Names: Althaea, Cat, Kathra, Heskan, Model 15j, Janet, Merla, Spoon, Sutha, Zanna Automaton Family Names: Brawnhammer, Dinner, Galanodel, Hunter/Seeker, Kerrhylon, Pillow, Nackle, Smith, Tealeaf AUTOMATON GLYPH Each automaton is distinguished by a unique, glowing, coin-sized glyph somewhere on its body. The importance of this symbol is unknown, and it resists all attempts to decipher it, whether mundane or magical. You can choose the location of your glyph or use the following table to determine where it is. You can decide whether to display your glyph openly or cover it with a piece of clothing. Automaton Glyph Location d8 Location d8 Location 1 Forehead 5 Back 2 Chest 6 Foot 3 Leg 7 Hand 4 Arm 8 Back of the head AUTOMATON TRAITS Your automaton character has the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Ability Score Increase. Automatons are produced for a variety of different functions. One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and another score increases by 1. Optionally, three scores of your choice each increase by 1. Age. Automatons do not visibly age and do not suffer the effects of aging, but they are not immortal. Unless violence or tragedy claims its life before then, an automaton’s body simply shuts down exactly 150 years after the moment it emerged from its pod. Alignment. Most automatons tend to have a polarized view of the world. Creatures and their deeds are either good or bad, orderly or chaotic. A few deliberately shun this way of thinking, embracing the concept of neutrality. Size. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Artificial Life Form. You were created to resemble humans, but because you are an artificial life form, you gain the following benefits: Enhanced Physiology. You need to breathe, eat, and sleep, but you can go without breathing for a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can go without eating or sleeping for a number of days equal to your proficiency bonus. Disease Immunity. You are immune to disease, whether natural or magical in nature. Accelerated Healing. Once every 24 hours, when you recover hit points by finishing a short rest or from magical healing, you recover twice the normal amount.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Wastes of Chaos"},{"name":"Automaton","description":"Automaton When the Karelagne Empire discovered the portal to the Aetherial Expanse, everything changed on their homeworld. One of the most profound changes was the unlocking of the potential for aether and aetherium to allow for the creation of magitech technology. The technology brought about by magitech revolutionized many aspects of life in the Empire, from manufacturing to warfare. And it also created a new type of being: the automaton. The first automatons were fairly simple beings, powered by aetherium and built for mundane, specific tasks. As years passed, however, these constructed beings began to display varying levels of sentience. Recently, as more and more of these beings were created and put to work in Karel, some have taken on personalities as complex and nuanced as any organic creature. And most importantly, they have begun to desire more than the tasks they were created to perform. Those who were too vocal or vehement in their demands caused unrest, and even panic, in some communities. One of the best ways to ensure an automaton rebellion never happened was to assign those constructs to work in the Aetherial Expanse. However, in doing so, they also gave these creatures more of an opportunity to leave the employ of the Empire and seek their own destinies. Nearly all automatons are given a designation when created. Standard imperial identification begins with AU (for aetherium unit), followed by a hyphen and another abbreviation for their profession (e.g., M for mechanic, L for laborer, etc.), and a unique three-digit identification number. Automations who rebel against their makers sometimes take other names or designations, while others keep their old designations as a reminder of what their lives used to be like. Most automatons have a roughly humanoid shape, but are comprised of inorganic materials and powered by an aetherium battery. More advanced versions might have swappable parts to support performing different tasks. Automaton Base Traits All automaton characters have the following traits: Age. Your age depends on when you were created and given life. The longer you have been alive, the more time you’ve had to develop your individual personality and socialize with others. Otherwise, automatons have no prescribed lifespan. Creature Type. You are a Construct. Languages. You speak Common. Size. You are Medium. Traditional Automaton Abilities If you prefer to use the Fifth Edition’s standard approach for defining racial traits, your automaton character has the following traits: Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice also increases by 1. Speed . Your walking speed is 30 feet. Artificial Form. You are a Construct, but your enchanted form still benefits from healing spells. You can also heal yourself by spending Hit Dice and finishing a long rest. In addition, you are immune to diseases, and you don’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. You still need to rest for a full 8 hours during a long rest to gain long-rest benefits. If the mending spell is cast on you, you can spend a Hit Die to regain a number of hit points equal to its roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). Additionally, at the discretion of your GM, you can benefit from further magitech enhancements, such as from a technomage wizard’s Infuse with Aetherium ability. However, your aetherium power core is volatile. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, roll a d6. On a 1, you die as your aetherium battery explodes. Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) force damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Magical Savvy. You learn one cantrip of your choice from any spell list and can cast it using the associated ability score: Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for cleric and druid spells, and Charisma for bard, sorcerer, and warlock spells. If the spell appears on multiple spell lists, choose one to determine the spellcasting attribute for that spell. Natural Attack. Your unarmed strikes deal damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and the type of damage is either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing based on the type of natural weaponry you choose. Well Protected. When you are not wearing armor, your AC is equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":32048},"publisher":"Ghostfire Gaming","book":"Aetherial Expanse Setting Guide"},{"name":"Avia-Ra","description":"Upon the Black and Night Crusade, Rode the fearless, heroes they. Citadel, unto their grasp, Fleets adjoined; O' pilgrim's wrath. Prostrate ‘fore the Sun Above, All to arms – never love. — 3rd Hymn of the Night Crusade The avia-ra are a sun-worshipping race of wingless birdmen, which appear to primitive cultures to spread their ancient religion. Ancient God-Kings Depictions of the avia-ra can be found in the ruins of ancient cultures throughout the galaxy. Often, but not always, they are portrayed as divinity manifest: god-like travelers from the heavens. They arrive as evangelists to share the philosophy of their solar religion—that the Sun Above is the only true god—and remain long enough to build an enduring civilization on the primitive world. Some races consider the avia-ra an ancient and wise people, dedicated to their religion and its tenets. Others cast them as charlatans and false prophets, who routinely prey upon primitive and defenseless peoples. The truth depends largely on perspective, but the avia-ra view themselves only as a grand tool to carry the momentum of the sun's glory to new peoples. Watchers of the Citadel The heart of the avia-ra's religion is at the Solar Citadel, which revolves close around the Sepulcher Star. Most aviara make pilgrimage to this site at least once in their lives to bask in the rays of their holy sun, which (in their philosophy) gives light and meaning to all other stars. Their worship of the sun is always directed at the Sepulcher Star itself, even if they are nearer to another star or to no star at all. All other stars merely act as a metaphor, a symbol, for their holy sun. In contrast to their binary doctrines, their actual relationship to the star and the Sepulcher within it is more complicated. The Solar Citadel definitively ensures that the star is under avia-ra control, but Old Un has never spoken to the avia-ra directly from within the star. Despite the silence, the avia-ra continue to pray in reverence and make pilgrimage to the Sepulcher Star. Deep Symbolism Avia-Ra are inclined to view the events around them as omens of much larger struggles, such as those between light and dark, good and evil, and law and chaos. All things have symbolic importance to them; even fundamentally objective things like science and mathematics have a place in the underlying allegory for avia-ra. Most avia-ra hold dreams in especially high regard, for interpreted dreams can tell the future, lend insight into the past, or provide guidance for the present. Those with the gift to interpret dreams are honored highly as priests in the avia-ra and given elaborate titles, such as Grand Remembrancer, or Dream-Teller Most High. Avia-Ra Names Avia-Ra names come in two-part cartouches, with one or both parts of the name being composed of the names of ancient avia-ra heroes and great ideals. Front Cartouche. Anubis, Apophis, Cani, Canopis, Helio, Horus, Ira, Isis, Nefer, Oculus, Terra, Verum Rear Cartouche. Amet, Bast, Haten, Hotep, Intef, Lux, Ma’at, Mose, Omet, Osiris, Ptah, Set, Thoth Avia-Ra Traits Though different avia-ra families may have different bird heads, all avia-ra have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1. Age. Avia-Ra are long lived, and due to their long lives, they have been revered as gods by more primitive beings. They reach maturity at roughly 30 years of age, and can live as long as 500 years. Alignment. The avia-ra draw their morality and philosophy from the sun. Though this solar religion can be severe, fatalistic, and dogmatic, most avia-ra have an inclination towards good—or at least lawful—alignments. Size. Avia-Ra stand between 5 and 6 feet in height, and weigh roughly 120 to 170 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. You have a base walking speed of 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to the rituals of your ancestors, the light of the sun dances in your eyes and grants you superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Avia-Ra Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the avia-ra sunstaff, scimitar, shortbow, spear, and whip. Doctrine. You have proficiency in the Religion skill. Blessings of the Sun. You can cast the spell bless, targeting only yourself, without using a spell slot. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell. For the spell’s duration, if you roll a 4 on the d4 that you add to an attack roll or saving throw, you gain advantage on that attack roll or saving throw. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Sun’s Chosen. You know the sacred flame and thaumaturgy cantrips. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Avia-Ra. Avia-Ra is a language filled with soft consonants and long vowel sounds. Its written form uses the Celestial script.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Mage Hand Press","book":"Dark Matter Starter Kit"},{"name":"Bearfolk","description":"All bearfolk share an inherent iron resolve, but none more so than those who call the Shadow Realm their home. The bearfolk who hail from the Moonlit Glades are hardened by a life of constant peril—the ever-present battle against shadow corruption. Only by banding together in tight-knit communities dedicated to fulfilling their noble purpose have the bearfolk miraculously continued to thrive. Since Mesikämmen the Bear King issued his fateful decree, the bearfolk have fought to stand as a source of light in the Shadow Realm. While most of the region is deadly to even the most capable of travelers, the bearfolk have carved out pockets of safety guarded by druidic magic. Hard-won wisdom has taught the bearfolk the secrets of resisting and purifying shadow corruption. As their mission to drive back the darkness has grown over the centuries, generations of bearfolk have been born in the Shadow Realm. And the longer they stay, the more of each new generation shows an innate power to shape the darkness that surrounds them. Bearfolk Names Bearfolk are given cub names by their parents, and when they come of age, they earn a new name, either bestowed upon them by an elder or one they choose themselves. This name befits a deed undertaken during their rite of passage into adulthood, describes some honorable or prominent trait of the bearfolk in question, or honors an ancestor. Male Names: Beorst, Cauldvyr, Cirdhan, Dorngal, Erlundt, Gurralt, Hrosvir, Lhod, Nodhr, Yrn. Female Names: Anga, Burli, Daegna, Durtta, Farla, Ingyrd, Johanna, Padhra, Sivaer, Tuli.

Shadowborn Bearfolk Bearfolk in Midgard The bearfolk have a rich history throughout the Northlands of the Midgard campaign setting. You can find additional bearfolk options in Midgard Heroes Handbook .","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Book of Ebon Tides Compendium"},{"name":"Bearfolk","description":"Bearfolk are massive people of iron resolve and deep nobility, resembling bears that walk upright rather than all fours. Hailing from either the cold climates of Midgard’s Northlands or from a nation of light carved out of the Shadow Realm itself, bearfolk put their trust in family and tribe to stand against the world. In defiance of their brutish appearance, they are deeply spiritual and artistic. Fearsome and Strong Bearfolk are broad-shouldered, bipedal humanoids. Although they strongly resemble upright bears, they have longer legs than any bear and their massive hands are more like a human’s hand than a bear’s paw. They lack the bear’s sharp claws, but they’re as dextrous as any human craftsman’s. Their muscles develop early in life, and most bearfolk look it. Their physiques tend toward great bulk beneath shaggy fur. Even the slenderest bearfolk are quite strong. Bearfolk are over 7 feet tall when they stand at their full height, but they often appear shorter because of a natural forward roll to their shoulders. They weigh between 250 and 350 pounds. They’re covered in shaggy fur that can have a range of colors. The most common colors are black and brown, often with a lighter frosting or tip on the chest, shoulders, and upper back. Coppery red, honey-colored, and even pure white fur occur rarely. The color gives a clue to the particular bearfolk’s heritage, but it’s not an exact indicator. As they age, bearfolk tend to go silvery around the muzzle, giving them a distinguished look. Tribe and Family The core of bearfolk society is the immediate family. Parents care for their cubs until the young reach the age of 5 or 6 years, when a precocious shift takes over. Although they aren’t yet fully grown, the cubs are drawn by a powerful urge to explore. They begin spending time away from their family, treating their entire village (or smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement) as a sort of extended family. This can be surprising or even annoying for nonbearfolk neighbors, who might discover a bearfolk child rooting through their pantry for a snack, inviting itself to dinner, or even adopting them as its new family temporarily. This isn’t necessarily as inconvenient as it sounds, since young bearfolk are also more enthusiastic learners and harder workers around the house than most other children their age. Beyond immediate family, the tribe forms the majority of bearfolk culture. Once bearfolk cubs start venturing beyond their own homes, families intertwine. Each cares for the cubs that happen by that day, welcoming the wayward children to meal tables as their own. There’s no choice but to know one’s neighbors in a bearfolk tribe, and that brings them all closer together. Trade apprenticeships and budding talents are identified early thanks to this intermingling, and it helps find a suitable niche for a young bearfolk’s path in life. Elders are highly respected for their experience and greater perspective, but practicality carries weight as well. Being old doesn’t afford one unlimited leeway if one makes questionable decisions or has a reputation for foolishness. Building on this respect, bearfolk venerate their ancestors at a nearly demigod level and believe the spirits of their ancestors guide them. The tribe also holds druids and clerics (particularly those that serve nature deities) in high respect and looks to them for guidance. Home and Honor When establishing homes, bearfolk gravitate toward striking a balance with nature and their impact on it. Even the most urban-minded of them prefer parks and greenery, and take pains not to disrupt the surrounding countryside any more than necessary. Where possible, they love to incorporate existing caves and rock formations into their architecture. Settlements always hold a totem, statue, or some other representation honoring an ancestor of virtue at their center. The bearfolk place a high value on honesty, trust, hard work, and community. These are the virtues that bring a bearfolk honor, and the same attributes make an outsider welcome. Laws governing bearfolk life are simple and loose. They trust in their core values to guide them wisely when disputes arise. In the rare instance when a disagreement can’t be settled according to custom, honor, and common sense, the elders become involved. Defying the judgment of elders for personal gain is a source of great shame that can ruin a bearfolk in the eyes of his or her tribe and family. Passion and Wrath Their intimidating mien is no veneer. Bearfolk have a deep and impressive capacity for violence when roused to anger or in defense of their own. Bearfolk passions run as strong as their bodies, and banter that pushes the boundary into insults and bruised honor often leads to more bruises. Their great physical strength means they excel at battle, and even relatively minor physical altercations can inadvertently become serious. Many bearfolk wear scars from physical contests, both simple competition and more serious matters of wounded honor, that went a little too far. Thanks to their physical prowess, many bearfolk follow the path of the warrior. Barbarians and fighters are common, with rangers and druids following closely. When bearfolk go to war, they do so with the clear goal of protecting their people in the moment and in the future. If that means the destruction of a foe, then so be it. They are adept at weaving their talents together in the same manner they blend families into tribes. Spellcasters favor turning the natural world against their foes with conjured beasts and manipulating battlefield conditions through weather, controlling plants, and even shaping the earth itself. Bearfolk Names Bearfolk are given cub names by their parents, similar to names found throughout the Northlands. When a bearfolk comes of age, they earn a new name, either bestowed upon them by an elder or one they choose themselves.

He was always hunched over, but still seemed tall to me. I remember his big, ursine face, smiling down at me. A good man, he treated me (despite my own differences) with such kindness. Maybe we shared that, being different. I felt so safe with him. But he grew old too fast and one day he just wandered back into the woods…\" —Fyrkat, Seerguard Once an ordinary animal living a content life in the forests, seas, or skies of Grimnir, the beastborn became enamored with raiders, their villages, their ships, and gradually, day after day, they started to act like them. Started to become them. The beastborn strongly resembles the creature it once was, though no matter its original size, it has grown (or shrunk) to roughly human height. They look like an animal that has simply decided to walk upright, emulating the raiders they admire. Intensely Curious When the beastborn first saw raiders in their sleek ships and clever towns, they caught a glimpse of a world beyond their forests and plains, their seas and skies. They started to think differently. They lingered on the fringes of raider villages, watching, learning… wondering. And then one day… Well, it happens differently for each beastborn, but more or less they decide. They decide to take the shape of the raiders they see. And they just do. For a beastborn, Grimnir is an amazing place. They appreciate this more than most for they understand both the wonders of the natural world (the comfort and joy of simply surviving amidst the beautiful forests and mountains and seas) as well as the more complicated marvels of civilization. They long to make the most of their short life and learn and see all that they can. Torn Between Two Worlds Though curious about the raiders they admire, they are also deeply attached to their own kind. The struggle to belong to both groups can be hard, but ultimately rewarding. Their two worlds offer lessons well worth learning. Though they have learned the language of their new community, they have not forgotten how to speak (and to listen) to others of their kind. The One and Only The beastborn can live within either animal or humanoid communities, but each individual has never met another being similar to themselves. But that has seldom presented any problems for them. Though they often look quite bestial, other raiders never really see them as they truly are. The magic of Grimnir softens their roughest features. Just Another Raider A bear beastborn might truly be the equivalent of a ferocious grizzly bear walking on two legs, but to his companions, she is merely an overly hairy and muscular raider. Beastborn Names Beastborn take great care to pick a name that fits their appearance or personality. Usually, these names are compounds words with two or more phrases spelling out the name. Companions will often shorten or adjust these names to a suitable nickname. Names: Big-Horn, Book-Reader, Drowsy-Boat, Gleaming-Mane, Lake-Talker, Never-Falls, Running-Fast, Smells-Better, Twitching-Ears, Wide-Shoulders. Beastborn Traits Beastborn have the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Age. You are only a few years old and will age quickly, reaching old age by thirty. Size. You are Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Beast Speak. You can communicate with other creatures of your original kind. Unique. There is no one else quite like you in all the world—never has been, never will be. Use the becoming beastborn system below to construct a beastborn of Grimnir. Becoming Beastborn You start with a pool of 12 beast points. Work through the following sections to spend these points to acquire the features you believe represent the race you are building. The first step is to decide why you awakened and which beastborn aspects resonate most with you. Perhaps you are: A boar that seeks out knowledge, collecting and reading tomes from across the world, learning as much about the raiders and their past as is possible. A squirrel who wants to feel the thrill of leading a raiding party across the sea. A goat that craves to not only learn the culture of the raiders but is excited to add to it—composing great ballads to be sung in feast halls across Grimnir. Once you have a vision in mind start spending the points. Spending Beastborn Points In the following descriptions a [-X] means it costs you X points to acquire that feature. A [+X] means you have selected a limitation that adds X points back into your pool. Beast Features Choose your beast type from these three options: Hunter & Gatherer , Fish , and Fowl .

The jump made by this feature does not expend your movement Long-limbed [-3]. When using a melee weapon your reach with that weapon is increased by 5 feet. Longer-lived [-1]. Your lifespan is that of a Human. Modified Unarmed Strike [-3]. You may use the claws, horns, teeth, or hooves of your original form to make unarmed strikes.

Natural Armor [-4]. When you select your animal of origin, you must pick your natural armor. You might be bulky (or have thick fur or skin) in which case you have an AC of 17 but are unable to increase this with dexterity modifiers or armor.

Poison Resistance [-2]. You have resistance to poison damage. Poison Tolerant [-1]. You have advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition. Powerful Build [-2]. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Skilled [-2].

This might be a bear hug or a python coiling around a foe. When you hit with your unarmed strike, you may use a bonus action to grapple the opponent (as long as they are no more than one size larger than you). Make a standard grapple check and if you win the opponent is considered grappled. Grappled foes can attempt to escape the grapple on their turn. The escape DC is 10 + your Strength (Athletics) modifier. Charge [-3]. If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack (on the same turn), you may use a bonus action to make one attack with your unarmed strike. Fearsome Bite [-2]. If you have grappled an opponent, you can perform a bite attack on them as a bonus action. You have advantage on the bite attack, which functions otherwise like a normal melee weapon attack and inflicts 1d6 piercing damage plus your Strength modifier if it hits. Natural Dash [-2]. When you take a dash action you may elect to run on all fours, increasing your movement by an additional 30 feet. Fish Features If you are a fish beast type, you can also purchase from the following list: Accustomed to the Water [-1].

Due to the dizzying variety of animals in the world, and beastfolk that take after them, beastfolk as a whole have few common bonds. They may form small communities, particularly if they all resemble the same animal, but most often live on the edges of civilization, interacting only with those who possess the insight to see beastfolk are at least as much human as they are animal. Fur & Feather Every beastfolk resembles an anthropomorphic animal of one kind or another. The ratio of humanoid to bestial qualities varies between beastfolk but they are always recognizable as a hybrid between beast and humanoid. Beastfolk can stand anywhere from three and a half feet to seven feet tall with their height being influenced by the size of the beast they take after. They likewise weigh anywhere from 60 to 300 pounds. Beastfolk may be covered in fur, feathers, scales, or skin. They often share the eye coloration and shape of the animal they resemble. Depending on their breed traits, a beastfolk may have wings, claws, gills, or even more exotic physical features. Born & Raised The majority of beastfolk are born as beastfolk. Members of beastfolk families all typically resemble the same species of animal. These beastfolk sometimes form isolated settlements that have little, if any, contact with other humanoid races. Many beastfolk who are born to the race identify strongly with the animal they resemble and so mistrust beastfolk who resemble that animal’s natural predators and other humanoids. Cursed & Broken Some rare beastfolk are unfortunate souls who were cursed to the shape. Whether they transgressed against the gods, crossed a foul-tempered spellcaster, or provoked a curse from a sorcerous relic, these beastfolk began their life as something else. Often the animal they resemble is some cruel or ironic reference to the circumstances surrounding their curse. For example, a gluttonous noble may be transformed into a pig beastfolk, a soldier who abandons their military post may be cursed to become a chicken beastfolk, and a cold-hearted assassin might be turned into a serpent beastfolk. Why They Adventure Beastfolk who take up a life of adventuring do so to survive. Beastfolk are often treated poorly by other humanoids, giving them few options for making a living that don’t involve risking their lives. Those who live alone in the wilderness might take up adventuring because the natural resources or security of their homeland are threatened. Beastfolk who are cursed to the form may have been adventurers before they took on their bestial appearance. Regardless of when or how, many of these beastfolk’s adventuring careers revolve around looking for a way to reverse the curse and return to their old selves. Rarely, over the course of adventuring the beastfolk grows accustomed to their new shape and abandons or even rejects attempts to return them to their old form. In a party, those traits that set beastfolk apart from other humanoids become their greatest assets. In the crucible of a danger filled dungeon, beastfolk quickly earn the trust and friendship that so often eludes them. Beastfolk Names Beastfolk names vary by their background. Beastfolk cursed to their form typically keep their old names, though some take on a new one to mask their true identity. Those born as beastfolk have a personal name and a community name. Their personal name is given to them by their parents at adolescence and reflects a notable physical characteristic, hobby, or habit. The community name is the name of the settlement or region where the beastfolk was born. Personal Names: Brownfeather, Cheeks, Chirp, Finder, Fullbelly, Growler, Hunter, Knuckles, Redfur, Shadow, Strongtail, Swift, Tails, Tusk Community Names: Baratok, Bluestones, Cloakwood, Erie, Greensea, Ironwood, Lammania, Moonshae, Styrnia, Taer Valaestas, Tethir, Whitewater Beastfolk Traits You share the following traits with other beastfolk. Ability Score Increase. Increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and a different ability score of your choice by 1. Age. Beastfolk age as humans do, reaching maturity in their late teens and rarely living beyond a century. Alignment. Beastfolk are more likely to follow their instincts before any law or code of ethics. As a result, they are typically chaotic and more often neutral than evil or good. Size. Beastfolk come in all sizes. You can choose to be Medium or Small. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. All Creatures Under the Sun. Choose a beast that you resemble. You have 3 breed traits of your choice that are representative of that animal. Beastkin Tongue. You can speak with beasts of the type you resemble, and similar creatures, as if under the effect of the speak with animals spell. For example, if you are a lion beastfolk you can speak with lions and other cats, whereas if you are an owl beastfolk you can speak with owls and other birds of prey. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common. Born beastfolk speak humanoid languages with difficulty and often unintentionally intermix it with beastial squeaks and snarls. Cursed beastfolk speak humanoid languages as naturally as they did prior to their transformation. Chimerakin When a beastfolk begins to manifest characteristics of two or more beasts, rather than just one, other beastfolk are likely to label them a chimerakin. This label means ostracization from any beastfolk community the chimerakin encounters, including their family. Other than the distinction in social standing, there is no difference between a beastfolk and a chimerakin (except that chimerakin can speak with two or more types of animals with their Beastkin Tongue trait). With your DM’s permission when you make your beastfolk character, you can roll a d100 to determine whether or not you are chimerakin. If you roll the number 13, the breed traits you select with your All Creatures Under the Sun trait do not have to be representative of a single creature. Otherwise, beastfolk with the Beast Whisperer feat are often accused of having chimerakin blood while those with the Extra Breed Traits feat are nearly universally condemned as chimerakin. Breed Traits Choose and gain three of the following traits. Each trait can only be selected once. Adept Climber. You have proficiency in your choice of the Athletics or Acrobatics skill.

It almost seems as if they are a people that had died and been reborn in the wrong place and time. Many times in my travels have I seen the ancient structures of the belare. Barely worthy of being called ruins, they are some of the beautiful sights I’ve seen in my lifetime. What must they have been when these places were in their time of greatest splendor? And if they serve as an example of their people, perhaps such beings could once have been as gods.” — Phola Kalstrei, Eldori loremaster There are few that can say they have visited a modern day belare colony, though there are ancient ruins scattered throughout the galaxy. These grand, archaic structures are the only link between the origins of the ancient species and those of the rest of the spacefaring races. Of the Stars The belare are a race of energy beings. Their bodies are formed from a glowing radiance similar to the energy generated by a star, but on a much smaller scale. When looked upon, their radiant form takes the shape of a stout humanoid merely a few feet in height, but this form is less of a definition and more of a form created by the belare themselves. Their bodies generate a tremendous amount of heat, and so when traveling away from their colonies, they wear containment suits to safely communicate and interact with their spacefaring neighbors. Lost Legends The belare as a species are thousands of years old. Due to this age only remnants of records still exist, mostly in the form of ancient written texts and carvings. These records describe the belare as the last of several powerful spacefaring races, all long extinct. Some of the oldest of their ruins are a mystery to the belare themselves. As such, it’s a popular belief they may not have always been the embodiment of the stars they are today. Now in their modern era, the belare use these old structures as meeting grounds and safeholds when dealing with neighbors and allies. Some of the oldest belare have their own records, some even memories, of the lost days of their vast empire, but much of these have amounted to no more than old tales and myths. Rules of Containment Due to their nature, belare are unable to interact with the rest of the galaxy the way other races can. Contact with other organisms disorients the belare physically and causes severe damage to those around them. Each belare has their own personalized bio-containment suit. It bears both humanoid and robotic features, forged from a combination of sorium and biosynthetic material. These suits are not interchangable, being attuned to each belare’s specific energy signature and fitted with an array of sensors. Each suit also bears specific markings for identification. A belare suit is an extension of their senses. They can choose to disable their tactile senses, but such an action limits their ability to channel their energies. As all belare have innate talents, most choose to experience the same vulnerabilities as other races in order to keep their material connection to their environment intact. Belare Names Belare mate by combining their energies, their physiology allowing them to create up to two offspring. As the belare are genderless, such differences are not presented in any of their names. Their given names are a combination of the names of their parents, the oldest usually making up the first part of the name. These combination names end with “ia” for the firstborn, and “us” for the secondborn. Belare who have offspring but take on the role of a sole parent can sometimes provide a variation of their own name instead. Sample Names: Agomatus, Arrolus, Calivalus, Kanaria, Ladrania, Larillia, Nuvellus, Prinaksus, Selrivia, Tunimia, Vandalia Belare in Your Campaign The belare are not as common in the Silrayne Arc as the other major races. They can be found in major cities and space stations, but in more remote areas of the galaxy, especially areas without access to the SIM (see Chapter 8), the belare are considered to be the stuff of legends. Due to their uncommon nature and special circumstances that can arise in-game, the use of belare as a player race is completely at the discretion of the GM. Belare Traits As a belare, you have the following traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence, Constitution, and Charisma all increase by 1. Age. Belare reach adulthood within 10 years. They live to be close to 200, though the oldest belare claim to have been alive for over a thousand years. Alignment. Because they tend to keep themselves impartial to outside affairs, belare tend to be neutral in alignment, though many lean toward good in terms of morality and respect for life. Size. Physically, your form is amorphous, usually taking the shape of a 3 to 4 foot humanoid. A belare suit is on average about 7.5 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Infravision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were in dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Also, only while in dim light or darkness, you can choose to see and discern heat signatures within a specified range through up to 5 feet of non-metallic solid material. Suit Resiliency. While wearing your containment suit, you have advantage on saving throws against poison are resistant to poison damage. You are immune to disease. Radiant Form. You have resistance to radiant damage. While exposed from or are outside of your containment suit, you are immune to radiant damage and vulnerable to necrotic damage. Natural Defense. While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. While wearing medium or heavy armor, all of your Dexterity (Stealth) checks are made with a disadvantage. Any class features that grant AC bonuses due to being unarmored are ignored. Artificial Body. Your body is a bio-mechanical containment unit. You can be targeted by and subject to the effects of attacks and powers that specifically target automatons and constructs. You do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. Esper powers and effects can’t cause you to age or put you to sleep. You regain hit points from healing powers and other healing effects the same as any other organic species. You also gain the same benefit from 4 hours of uninterrupted rest that a human normally would from 8 hours of sleep. Esper Initiate. You gain use of the renew talent. Also, at 3rd level you can use the light beam talent once, after which you must complete a long rest before you can use it again. Constitution is your channeling ability for this talent. At 6th level, your light beam talent upgrades to rank 3, then to rank 4 at 11th level and rank 5 at 16th level. Languages. You speak, read, and write Common and Protean. Belare Containment Suits Containment suits are linked and bound to a belare’s bio-signature. These suits are treated as their physical bodies, subject to damage in the same manner as any other character. They are extremely durable and cannot be forced open without consent from the belare attuned to it. As a belare, once bound to your containment suit, leaving your suit causes you to expel energy and suffer severe stress. Your physical form can be exposed for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). At the start of each round thereafter, you suffer one level of exhaustion, which can’t be removed by any powers or effects. At six exhaustion levels, your body is reduced to a pile of fine dust. Closing a containment suit requires an action. Taking a long rest removes all levels of exhaustion you gained as a result of being outside of your suit. In addition, a creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of a belare’s exposed form takes 3 (1d6) radiant damage. This has no effect on other belare.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":27051},"publisher":"Alligator Alley Entertainment","book":"Esper Genesis Core Manual"},{"name":"Bisque Geppettin","description":"“As soon as he reached home, Geppetto took his tools and began to cut and shape the wood into a Marionette.” —Carlo Collodi, Le Avventure di Pinocchio Ever a joy to children, geppettin resemble living playthings made of wood, cloth, or porcelain. Though easily mistaken for puppets, geppettin aren’t manipulated by a just-out-of-sight puppeteer; they are animated, sentient, and independent. Living Toys As a race, the geppettin are an oddity. Though rare, they are numerous enough and share enough similarities that they may be counted as an actual race of people, and not merely freak mishaps of magic. While there might be dedicated creators of geppettin, as there are with golems, many geppettin come to life on their own. Physically, geppettin are often shorter than halflings. Their physical features vary greatly from type to type, but they are almost always humanoid in shape. For simplicity, geppettin are classified by their materials: bisque are porcelain, marionettes are wood, and plushies are made of fabric. Despite being made of somewhat flimsy materials, sentience grants them an odd hardiness. Additionally, due to their non-living nature, they never hunger, rarely tire, and are adept at being innocuous. Most find some form of work or profession in entertainment, but a few find fantastic success as spies and assassins. As living constructs, geppettin don’t age, and are mature as soon as they become sentient. Bisque Traits Bisque geppettin are a form of porcelain doll, crafted with exacting specification and luxurious clothing materials. Though they are designed to look as realistic as possible, they are often thought to be the most terrifying of geppettin due to their lifeless visage. Though their faces are often very fragile, their construction is generally much hardier than their brethren’s. As a bisque, you have the following racial traits: Ability Score Increase. Increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Typical: Dexterity +1, Constitution +1, Charisma +1 Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. However, spells and effects that specifically affect Constructs affect you as well. Size. You are Small. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light, and darkness as if it was dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Construct Anatomy. You are immune to nonmagical diseases. You don’t need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest by spending 4 hours in a motionless state, during which you retain consciousness. False Appearance. While you are motionless, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary porcelain doll. Sudden Strike. Whenever you deal damage to a creature with a weapon attack roll on your first turn in combat, the creature takes extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Unnerving. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill, and have advantage on any Charisma (Intimidation) rolls in you make against a creature that hasn’t previously seen you move.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Mage Hand Press","book":"Valda's Spire of Secrets"},{"name":"Bugbear","description":"Bugbear Traits Your bugbear character has the following racial traits.

By my sword, I claim this place and name it Rhukaan Draal, the crown city of Darguun, the land of the people!” —Don Bassingthwaite, The Doom of Kings The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bug bears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands of years. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire. City Goblins Goblins dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War. The Ghaal’dar The Ghaal’dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal’dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bug bear peers. The history of the Ghaal’dar is filled with strife; when they weren’t fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal’dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal’dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun (see chapter 2). The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos. As a Ghaal’dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal’dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you’re seeking allies to reclaim your birthright. The Marguul The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the Ghaal’dar long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal’dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide. As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It’s certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you’ve taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally. The Heirs of Dhakaan Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds of corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire. The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal’dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they’ve dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani. The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don’t have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh’dar (“silent folk”), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh’dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin. As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani? Goblinoid Names Goblinoid names often feature drawn-out vowel sounds (represented by doubled letters), as seen in the names of both their ancient empire (Dhakaan) and their newborn country (Darguun). Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use the same names and naming conventions, despite their tribal differences.

Now, this goal becomes compromised when everyone around you is fighting religious wars. As the conflicts got worse, many gnomes retreated from civilization. They hid in secluded places, magically protected their cities from being seen and kept contact with most other races to a minimum. Their closest contacts in most places were halflings, as they shared a divine pantheon and a lot of cultural aspects derived from that. The majority of gnomes simply tried to keep out of trouble. In their hidden villages and cities, they focused on what was important to them. But some of them understood that things wouldn't end well, and they tried to do something about it. And when a gnome decides to get involved in something, they do it with passion. During the last years of Virthys, the old world has seen an overproportional number of gnomish heroes. In the final war of the dragon gods, some of them led entire armies into battle, or accomplished critical missions to stop Zathruax. Of course, none of that was enough to prevent the apocalypse. It was a shock to most gnomes - both those who got involved in the battles, and those who lived in seclusion. But there was a third group, who called themselves the Shield Bearers. These gnomes asked the question that everyone else was too afraid to ask: What is the worst thing that could happen? And the Shield Bearers got the answer right. They predicted the end of the world, and they prepared for it. The big question was: How can you survive when nothing else does? And after years of research, experiments and engineering masterwork, they found a solution: Void Carapace Armor. Expecting to end up in literal nothingness, these gnomes built armors for themselves that could sustain and protect them. They built many thousands of these protective suits, equipped with some of the best magic and technology gnomes had ever created. When Zathruax ripped Virthys apart, many gnomes actually survived thanks to this invention - even on regions that would not become a part of Ashandri. Their fate is unknown, and it's entirely possible they still drift in the empty space that was left after the world died. But those who ended up on Ashandri met a different fate. Being transported to Braythe changed something in the arcane core that powered the Void Carapace Armors. In the seconds after the dimensional shift, the protective suits began to shine with an intense violet light. What followed was a magical explosion, which ripped both the armors and the gnomes inside apart. But just as Braythe was reborn, so were the gnomes. The shreds and pieces of both armor and gnome bodies were pulled back into the arcane core, fusing the gnomes with their carapace armors. This was the moment the Carapace Gnomes were born. Carapace Gnomes As with many newborn races in Ashandri, the Carapace Gnomes needed some time to adapt to their fate. Becoming half gnome, half engineered machine, many of them wondered what they even were. To some, their metamorphosis was so unbearable that they killed themselves, often with the very arcane forces that now flowed through their bodies. Of course, this only turned them into Unbound Spirits, making their fate even worse. Other Carapace Gnomes accepted their fate better. Some of them, engineers and sages in particular, try to figure out what exactly happened. Marisha Veilbreaker explicitly stated that their creation was not an effect of the magic that made Ashandri. The metamorphosis must have been triggered by a freak magical short circuit, something within the very fabric of reality in Braythe that activated an unforeseeable chain reaction in the Void Carapace Armors. A small amount of these protective suits went unused during the apocalypse, and actually made it to Ashandri. They, too, began to shine magically - but with no living being inside, the light simply vanished after a few seconds, leaving the suits unchanged. The gnomes also claim that the Void Carapace Armor is a safe way to travel the Braythian Void, even if they can't explain why. Within gnome society, the Carapace Gnomes are met without much prejudice. As usual, the members of this race react more with curiousity than anything else. But outside of their settlements, many people react shocked or even horrified. The organic body fused with machine parts is an unsettling sight at first. The soft electrical buzzing sounds that occasionally appear during movement don't exactly improve this impression. Most Carapace Gnomes were created in Delvaroth, but there were groups in what is now known as the Ocean Heart, too. They had retreated to swimming settlements there, so they could work mostly undisturbed. After the birth of the new world, some of these gnomes spread out to explore the new world. And a small group of them were determined to travel into the Void itself, finding clues to what exactly created them. There are also those trying to find a way back to their original reality. They can't stop thinking of those gnomes that survived the apocalypse in the original Void Carapace Armors. These castaways might still be drifting through the nothingness that was left after the world ended, and some of the Carapace Gnomes want to do everything they can to save them. The Arcane Core that fused with a Carapace Gnome's heart is seen as a valuable magical component by some ruthless spellcasters. While it's not something that happens constantly, there are tales of mercenaries and evil wizards hunting Carapace Gnomes to use their body parts for rituals. Traits A Carapace Gnome shares most of the traits that all gnomes have. The following traits replace the Gnome Cunning trait. Ability Score Increase: Constitution+1 Size: Carapace Gnomes keep their original size. But due to the engineered body parts, they average about 120 pounds. Your size category is Small. Age: Carapace Gnomes don’t seem to grow old - not even if they are kids. The new race is too young to say for certain if time affects them. There have been cases of magical aging that actually impacted them, so sages are really unsure how to evaluate the situation. Some parents actively seek ways to magically age their children, to allow them a way to mature normally. Implanted Tools: The body of a Carapace Gnome is half organic, half mechanical. Which parts are what differs from gnome to gnome. Implanted into the engineered parts is a set of tools that you can use as well as your own hands. Choose one toolset (for example, Thieves’ tools) as part of your body. It cannot be taken away from you, and it counts as always equipped. Checks made using these tools are always made with advantage. This ability replaces Gnome Cunning. Arcane Force: You can summon arcane lightning to engulf your fists or weapons with it. On a melee hit, you add 1d4 lightning damage to your attack, which counts as magical damage. Protective Carapace: You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class, stacking with worn armor and abilities like a fighter's fighting style. When making a Strength, Dexterity or Constitution Saving Throw to avoid damage from a spell or spell-like effect, you can choose to roll with Advantage. Once used, you need a long rest before you can use this ability again.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Catfolk","description":"Catfolk are a social and active people of natural grace and obsessive curiosity, resembling bipedal, feline humanoids with tails, cat-like ears, and fur. They are equally comfortable wandering in far-off regions, wallowing in the heart of the largest cities, or delving into the lair of forgotten horrors. Most catfolk dwell in the deserts and endless plains of the Southlands, but love of travel and new experiences often draw catfolk to distant realms. There are whispers of hidden catfolk communities in the Wungo jungles, beyond the Tunturi Range, or even far to the northeast in the Land of Frost and Bears. Two People, One Race Midgard hosts two main branches of catfolk, the mischievous and irrepressible basteti and the dauntless and fierce nkosi. While outwardly appearing to be two different feline races, the basteti and the nkosi share a common origin. Young catfolk learn this story from the elders. In the early days of the Southland, Bastet the cat queen and Gamka, the lion-headed titan, breathed life into tufts of fur plucked from the goddess’s tail and the titan’s mane. The power of these two children of the primordial Aurgelmir, the giant whose body became Midgard itself, worked to shape the first catfolk. However, the brief affair soon perished to the old enmity between god and titan. Central to their contention was the final form of the catfolk. Bastet desired these new creations to resemble her beloved cats while Gamka pushed for the fierce lions. After a brief but violent quarrel, the two divine beings went their separate ways, each taking some of the new mortals for themselves and shaping them according to their own whims. Some suggest Bastet achieved her revenge by engineering the fall of the titan empire, but others disagree, claiming the Cat Goddess would never be so blatant. Curiosity and Community Catfolk are nimble, curious and adventurous creatures who seek out life rather than wait for it to come to them. Some outsiders believe heedless self-expression alone drives the catfolk. As proof, they point to the basteti fascination with new experiences or the nkosi’s quest for heroic glory. Those who make this claim miss the catfolk’s inner strength. Catfolk are optimistic, quirky, sometimes extravagant extroverts who overindulge their own curiosity or motivations. They are a race of extremes. Some catfolk are playful and seemingly irresponsible while others possess unwavering focus and a hunter’s mentality. Many catfolk float between these two viewpoints as the situation—or their mood—dictates. All but the most introverted catfolk enjoy holding the attention of others, but never to the detriment of their friends or family. Harkening back to their ancestors’ packs and prides, friends, relations, and community hold a special place in the hearts of most catfolk. Because catfolk are a largely matriarchal people, females hold most positions of leadership and power, but competence usually supersedes gender. Catfolk living in mixed communities and cities such as Nuria largely integrate into the overall society. Other Races Catfolk get along well with anyone who respects them and accepts their curiosity. They easily accept humans and delight in halflings when they encounter them. Passionate, art-loving elves and boisterous dwarves find common ground with catfolk, while those too bogged down in laws, tradition and “rules” often find them aggravating. Kobolds and catfolk naturally intrigue each other, though catfolk do not always get along with dragonkin. Catfolk Adventurers Many catfolk take up the adventurer’s trade, as it provides an excuse to indulge in their natural curiosity or their glory hunting. Some take up the rogue’s path or find employment as a scout or ranger. Still others pledge themselves as paladins to Bastet or Gamka. The catfolk’s physical abilities and cultural outlook allows them to fill almost any role. Catfolk Eccentricity A catfolk’s personality can be flighty, flitting from obsession to obsession, or as constant as the World Tree itself. You can use some of the ideas in the following table to customize your character in addition to the elements of the background you chose. d10 Eccentricity 1 You constantly compare everyone’s actions to catfolk heroes of the past. 2 You keep a long list of places you want to go or things you want to do. 3 You must defeat a certain foe to fulfill your oath and reap the glory. 4 You find it amusing to act more bestial because it makes others nervous. 5 You are writing a song about your exploits. 6 You never like returning to a place you’ve already been. 7 Your weapons have names and you speak to them like siblings or lovers. 8 You tend to play with small objects. 9 You growl and show your teeth when things get tense. 10 You can’t help talking to strangers—the stranger the better.

Catfolk In Midgard Midgard hosts two main branches of catfolk, the mischievous and irrepressible basteti and the dauntless and fierce nkosi.

For more information about the basteti and nkosi, see the Southlands Player’s Guide. Given the small populations of the malkins and pantherans and their similarities with basteti, most believe they are off-shoots of the basteti, especially because Midgard pantherans never appear leonine. Many malkins and pantherans also hold this to be true and become devout followers of Bastet. Some families, however, have different stories for their origins. For some malkin families, their legends state the malkin were created by Loki, who was enamored with the natural curiosity and mischievousness of small cats. For some pantheran families, their legends state the pantherans were created by the ancient forests of Midgard as protectors of the natural world, though which forest birthed the first pantherans varies by family. Regardless of the stories, Bastet embraces all catfolk, and Loki’s favor is rarely out of reach for those seeking to cause mischief. As for the forests of Midgard, few can understand the wills and powers of these mysterious entities, and even they aren’t privy to all the forests’ secrets.

As much as they can, centaurs run—in wide plazas, spacious parks, and expanses of rubble and ruin. They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them, until the next wall looms in their path and brings them to a stop. Nature’s Cavalry Centaurs have the upper bodies, down to the waist, of muscular humans, displaying all the human variety of skin tones and features. Their ears are slightly pointed, but their faces are wider and squarer than those of elves. Below the waist, they have the bodies of small horses, with a similar range of coloration—from various shades of chestnut or bay to dappled or even zebra-like striped patterns. Most centaurs style their hair and their tails in a similar way. Selesnya centaurs favor long, flowing hair. Gruul centaurs cut their hair in rough, spiky styles. The upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to human torsos in size, and their lower equine bodies average about 4 feet tall at the withers. Though they are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse, they fill similar roles as cavalry warriors, messengers, outriders, and scouts. Affinity for Nature Centaurs have an affinity for the natural world. Among the guilds that share that affinity, centaurs favor the rubblebelts of the Gruul Clans and the wide plazas of the Selesnya Conclave over the undercity tunnels of the Golgari and the laboratories of the Simic . Centaurs celebrate life and growth, and the birth of a foal is always cause for festivities. At the same time, they revere the traditions of the past, and among both the Gruul and the Selesnya they are voices of memory and history, preserving old ways and keeping alive the legends of ancestral heroes. They feel a close kinship with wild animals, perhaps because of their own horse-like bodies, and delight in the feeling of running alongside herds and packs of other beasts. Clans and Community Centaurs sense the interconnectedness of the natural world. Thus, they celebrate family and community as microcosms of that greater connection. Among the Gruul , they have a strong clan identity, and Selesnya centaurs are fiercely loyal to their individual communities as well as the guild as a whole. Their love of history and tradition also means that centaurs are more likely than most other Ravnicans to join the same guild that their parents did. Centaur Names Centaurs’ given names are passed down through family lines. The name bestowed on a new foal is typically the name of the most recently deceased family member of the same gender, keeping alive the memory—and, the centaurs believe, some shard of the spirit—of the departed. Centaurs don’t use family names, but they wear symbols that represent their family membership. These symbols might include graphical representations of plants or animals, printed mottoes, braids and beads worn in the hair and tail, or even specific patterns of woven fabric. Male Names: Bonmod, Boruvo, Chodi, Drozan, Kozim, Milosh, Ninos, Oleksi, Orval, Radovas, Radom, Rostis, Svetyos, Tomis, Trijiro, Volim, Vlodim, Yarog Female Names: Daiva, Dunja, Elnaya, Galisnya, Irinya, Kotyali, Lalya, Litisia, Madya, Mira, Nedja, Nikya, Ostani, Pinya, Rada, Raisya, Stasolya, Tatna, Zhendoya, Zoria Centaur Traits Your centaur character has the following racial traits. These traits are also suitable for the centaurs of other worlds where there are centaurs of fey origin. These centaurs are smaller than the non-fey centaurs that roam in some realms. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Centaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans. Alignment. Centaurs are inclined toward neutrality. Those who join the Selesnya are more often neutral good, while those who join the Gruul are typically chaotic neutral. Size. Centaurs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with their equine bodies reaching about 4 feet at the withers. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 40 feet. Fey. Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid. Charge. If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves. Hooves. Your hooves are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Equine Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag. In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot. Survivor. You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. Sylvan is widely spoken in the Selesnya Conclave, for it is rich in vocabulary to describe natural phenomena and spiritual forces.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica"},{"name":"Centaur","description":"Centaur Powerful and curious, quick to act and knowledgeable of the wider world, centaurs seek to experience life's boundless bounty. The centaurs of Theros are divided into two groups: members of the far-traveling Lagonna band and the proud raiders of the Pheres band. These bands occupy territories situated between the three major human poleis, making them common sights to those who travel human lands. Not ones to settle in permanent homes, though, centaurs might be found wherever there are wonders to be witnessed and adventures to be had. Markings of the Herd Though centaurs share the same basic physiology, the centaur bands are commonly associated with their own distinct traits. Lagonna band centaurs tend to be sleek and muscular, with powerful legs built for endurance rather than speed. They usually have coats of a single color, often with a shine that can look metallic in bright light. Pheres band centaurs typically have long, nimble legs and lean bodies, and are often marked with natural color patterns on their hide. Pheres centaurs sometimes paint or tattoo their upper bodies to match the patterns on their lower half. Occasionally, a Pheres centaur is born with vertical stripes on their hooves, foretelling an exciting and adventurous life. Lagonna Band Centaur Lagonna Merchant Families Lagonna centaurs travel in small merchant family bands called guri . These groups frequently trade with Meletis, which provides the biggest market for their wares, but they also do business with Setessa and smaller communities within Akros's lands. The eldest member of each guros typically leads their family. In times of discord, the heads of the guri gather to make decisions together. Other members of the guros work as traders, gatherers, packers, and scouts. A guros has several specialized roles required for success in travel and trade: a barterer, an omener, a courser, and preferably a koletra . A barterer negotiates deals between the guros and other traders. Barterers must know the customs of other cultures and speak several different languages. An omener is an oracle who reads messages from the gods in the natural world and reveals how the immortals would have the guros travel. A courser explores new trade territory for their guros. They are expert trackers and navigators, able to venture deep into unexplored territory and unerringly return to their families. Finally, every guros tries to travel with at least one koletra, one of the mighty, well-trained warriors of the Lagonna who are said to have the blood of the first, legendary centaur heroes. Koletras are said to bring good luck to a band, but are also usually fated to die in defense of their family. Not every guros has a koletra of its own, and guri share their best warriors among each other as a sign of goodwill and a way to forge bonds. Journeys of Discovery When young Lagonna centaurs become adults, they often leave their band to travel the world on their own. This time of self-discovery, called a protoporos , can last anywhere from a few weeks to several years. The Lagonna believe that a protoporos helps young centaurs find their place in the world. An omener reads the signs of fortune before sending young centaurs on their way, guiding the first steps of their journey. While most centaurs return to the band eventually, some find their calling elsewhere. When the Lagonna tell tales of their greatest heroes, they often speak of centaurs who found their heroic destiny on a protoporos. Pheres Raiders The Pheres roam the wild lands between Setessa and Akros in small raiding herds. These herds are voluntary associations, in contrast to the family groups of the Lagonna. When necessary, several small bands join together in a larger herd to target particularly dangerous but resource-rich targets—be they humanoid traders or roving, greedy monsters. Bands also join together to defeat common threats or to hunt for game. The Pheres value physical strength, speed, and prowess in both hunting and combat. Often a band is led by the strongest and most dominant warrior, called the charger. However, some bands elevate a tactician or strategist to this venerated position. The Pheres can be brutal and greedy, but they are clever as well, and understand the value of strategic leadership. Other centaurs in Pheres herds work as scouts, archers, warriors, and foragers. In addition, most Pheres herds contain a caller and a tromper. Pheres callers are typically druids or rangers who can draw animal assistance to their herd. Callers often have one or more animal allies at their side, and can speak to animals to learn about the surrounding lands. Trompers are the most powerful and feared warriors of the herd. Centaur legends say that when the gods first fashioned humans from the red mud of the eldest river, Pheres trompers taught them how to corner and kill prey. The story tells that, to repay this debt, humans owe the centaurs a portion of what they catch. While humans don't recall this arrangement, the Pheres often cite it as justification for their raids. Pheres Band Centaur Pheres Renegades Pheres band members survive by working and fighting together, but still some centaurs choose to strike out on their own. These renegades often feel like outsiders in their own band. They might be pacifists, wishing to learn about other people rather than fighting them. Or they might feel a restlessness in their soul that nothing else can soothe. Though renegades build their own life away from the band, most retain some connection with their past. Some stories tell of renegades returning to help their band in times of need before disappearing once more. Centaur Names Lagonna centaurs tend to favor names of three or four syllables, often borrowed from cultures they have met during their travels. Pheres centaurs tend to have shorter, sharper sounding names, often appended with an honorific gained in battle. Female Lagonna Names: Honotia, Kelitia, Lileo, Meloe Male Lagonna Names: Aughus, Dririos, Ormasos, Volien Female Pheres Names: Bido, Daxa, Saya, Tesia Male Pheres Names: Eno, Roth, Skelor, Stihl Pheres Honorifics: Threekills, Razorhoof, Unsleeping, Daggereye, Silentstep Centaur Traits Your centaur character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Centaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans. Alignment. Centaurs are inclined toward neutrality. Lagonna centaurs tend to be more lawful, while Pheres centaurs are more often chaotic. Size. Centaurs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with their equine bodies reaching about 4 feet at the withers. Pheres centaurs tend to be slightly larger than Lagonna centaurs. Your size is Medium. Here's how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier: Size modifier = 1d10 Height = 6 feet + your size modifier in inches Weight in pounds = 600 + (2d12 × your size modifier) Speed. Your base walking speed is 40 feet. Fey. Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid. Charge. If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves. Hooves. Your hooves are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Equine Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag. In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet instead of the normal 1 extra foot. Survivor. You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":5432},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Mythic Odysseys of Theros"},{"name":"Centaur","description":"Centaurs gallop throughout the multiverse and trace their origins to many different realms.

Centaurs are neither man nor beast, but occupy a strange niche in both the civilized and natural worlds. They are born with grace befitting a human king, but are possessed of the fierce savagery of a wild stallion. Centaurs are a scattered race, roaming in small clan groups from the Rothenian Plain (where their numbers are great) to the court of the young Valeran Emperor, whom several serve as personal guards. But they also have a reputation for banditry and bullying, and most cultures consider them dangerous. Centaurs are largely a nomadic people. Their archery is excellent and their healing arts are well advanced. Because they have little interest in magic or in writing, other cultures sometimes disregard centaurs, but they do so at their peril. Large centaur hordes have smashed baronies and even small nations flat. Raiding and Banditry Upon reaching the age of majority, all young adult centaurs embark on their “bandit years,” a practice designed to siphon off those who are particularly troublesome and give some experience to more agreeable colts and fillies. These young centaurs run free, away from the clan groups, to exorcise their aggression and immaturity. At the end of this period, they can choose to remain outside their clan or horde, or they can return with the understanding that they have tamed their wild ways—at least to the degree that’s acceptable to centaur society. Most young adults choose to return after their bandit years, though the occasional centaur leaves the horde permanently out of curiosity, romance with another race, or any number of other factors. Young centaurs of the same age go on their bandit years together, with instructions from the clan chief about when they’ll be allowed to return. Centaurs believe in personal property, but they also believe that a person who claims to own something should be strong enough to defend it. They never steal from their clan, but anyone else is fair game. Shipments or supplies of grain and alcohol are their favorite targets. During a raid, centaurs take advantage of their speed, maneuverability, and skill in archery. They use diversions to draw defenders away from targets, or use heavy volumes of arrows to keep them pinned down. The bandit years are the time when centaurs drink most heavily. Within the clan, celebrations can be shockingly raucous, but everyday life is not. During the bandit years, however, young centaurs are drunk more often than not. This constant inebriation fuels more raids, fights, and reckless behavior. The bandit years are also the time when centaurs are most likely to take up a life of adventuring, even if only for a little while. Many centaurs spend their bandit years not strictly as bandits but as wanderers and adventurers, eventually returning to their clans with loot and stories. Centaur Names Centaur names are similar in many ways to elven names, but they emphasize synonyms for speed, strength, and daring. They sometimes incorporate a long list of deed names, but those are seldom trotted out except during formal occasions and when issuing challenges. Male Names. Barrazu, Farrushi, Gaddir, Gadjay, Harunmaza, Himfel, Lahza, Muhktif, Seflenn, Zadat Female Names. Ammida, Bassara, Firnala, Imudeema, Lahga, Leezai, Rashij, Simdisa, Tazgizi, Tifalza Centaur Traits Your centaur character has certain characteristics in common with all other centaurs. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Centaurs reach maturity at 15 years of age. Their lifespans vary because of the harsh conditions and martial nature of their culture, but the upper limits are similar to those of humans. Alignment. Centaur alignments are mainly chaotic and neutral. Size. Centaurs stand between 8 and 9 feet tall and weigh in excess of 1,000 pounds. Your size is Large. Speed. Centaurs have a base speed of 40 feet. Type. You are of the monstrosity type. Natural Attacks. You have proficiency with your hooves. You make one attack with your hooves, which deal 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Centaur Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the pike and the longbow. Pike Charge. If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a pike attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 3 (1d6) piercing damage. The number of extra damage dice you gain increases by one at 6th level (2d6) and again at 11th level (3d6). You can apply this extra damage only once per turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Humanoid Torso. Although you are Large, you wield weapons and wear armor sized for a Medium creature, thanks to the proportions of your humanoid torso. Quadruped. You have disadvantage on Stealth checks because of your size and indelicate hooves. The mundane details of the structures of humanoids can present considerable obstacles for you, such as ladders and manholes. Self-sufficient. You have proficiency with the Medicine skill. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Centaur and one other language of your choice.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":9},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Centaur (Thylean)","description":"A noble race that roams the great plains of the world, centaurs are both feared and respected by other intelligent creatures. Centaur legends claim that they are the offspring of a powerful god of war that came down to the mortal plane in the form of a stallion. They are proud of this divine heritage and demand that the proper respect be shown to them. Equine Nomads Centaurs possess a humanoid torso with a horse’s lower body. They are as varied in coloration and physical build as humans and horses. Their horse body can be chestnut brown, black as a nightmare, pure white as a unicorn, grey, and other colors between. They can be a single color, spotted, have white “socks,” or have hooves of different coloration. Their human bodies can be of any skin color from dark skinned to pale. Their human hair can be black, brown, blonde, or red—but it most often complements that of their horse body. Proud and Haughty Centaurs are a proud people. They view themselves as superior to all other races and demand respect and adulation. They can be vain about their appearance and are careful to be dignified and aloof in the presence of others. However, most centaurs are also fond of drink and once inebriated they can become loud, boorish, and dangerous. Centaur Tribes Centaurs are a tribal people. Centaurs are fiercely loyal to members of their tribe and will never leave one of their own behind. When they mate, they mate for life. If they join an adventuring group, they will often consider that group to be their current tribe and will be intensely loyal to their fellow heroes. They normally roam huge expanses of steppe land that they consider their domain. They don’t build settlements in these lands, but they are protective of them. While centaurs can be herbivores, they prefer meat and enjoy hunting, but they will resort to gathering fruit, nuts, and other plants if an area has been overhunted. Travelers who are respectful of the plants and animals in tribal territory are left alone, but those who disrespect nature or try to build permanent settlements of any kind will become a target of the tribe’s wrath. Centaurs in Thylea Centaurs are distrustful of the civilized races. In the First War that raged five centuries ago, thousands of centaurs were killed by the invading Dragonlords, and the centaurs have never forgotten or forgiven. The distrust is mutual, especially as centaur tribes are now flocking to the banner of Sydon and raiding outlying farms. Centaurs that enter a Thylean town or city will find that they are tolerated but kept under constant watch. The centaurs tend to worship the mother goddess, but they will sometimes offer prayers to one of the titans, Sydon or Lutheria. They never worship the Five. Centaur Names Centaurs have names that are specific to their race. These names can often be difficult for members of other races to pronounce, so they can adopt nicknames when traveling with a band of non-centaurs. Male Names : Agrius (Agri), Amycus (Amy), Asbolus (Az), Bienor, Chiron, Cyllarus (Cyl), Dictys, Eurytus (Tus), Elatus, Eurytion (Yuri), Hylaeus (Hyla), Nessus, Perimedes (Peri), Pholus, Rhoetus (Rote), and Thaumas (Tom). Female Names : Agaria, Biano, Cylla, Diena, Eura, Hylonome (Hylo), Heranae (Hera), Nessicana (Nessie), Nara, Ponadata (Pona), Rhaelatisis (Rala), Rhaena (Rain), and Seranu (Sara).

More insular than other humblefolk, cervans often reside deep in the most ancient parts of Humblewood’s vast forest, in tree stands and groves far from birdfolk perches. Hale and Hearty Cervans have a robust physique and are rarely sick. They are one of the longest-lived races among the humblefolk. Though their wariness has earned them a reputation as timid, cervans are cautious because they remain active and alert, and generally prefer practice to contemplation. Cervans like to pursue skills independently in order to give themselves a sense of purpose. This striving is what propels some cervans to positions of great import throughout the Wood. A happy cervan is one who is hard at work. Wary and Practical One of the reasons cervans form such close-knit communities is a mistrust of outsiders. Before the Treaty, vulpin raiders and mapach thieves were serious threats. These times have long since passed, but cervans still possess a wariness that makes it hard for others to gain their trust. After the implementation of the Humblefolk Treaty, many cervans continued to live by the old ways. However, some cervan villages have since started to contain the odd family of jerbeen, or a few lone hedges. Even under such circumstances, cervans have maintained positions of leadership and delegated responsibilities to make sure that villages are run in accordance with the old cervan teachings, ensuring that work necessary for survival in the most remote villages is accomplished, so that all its inhabitants may be kept healthy and happy. The ability to balance their innate caution with practical considerations is one of the cervans’ greatest strengths. Cervans teach that the best means of survival in any situation is to remain calm and weigh one’s options. The best cervan leaders favor this approach. The Sight Cervans have a unique ability to bounce back and survive a physical shock that might kill others. Occasionally, cervans who survive such traumas are granted mystical visions. Sometimes these are flashes of insight into the world around them, sometimes portents of doom, and other times visions of a far away future. Known among cervans as “The Sight”, this phenomenon is elusive, and out of the control of mortals. Cervans who have seen visions in this way are known as “The Sighted”, and after this initial event, some will suddenly find themselves receptive to visions of the past, present, and future. A cervan whose Sight has been triggered is encouraged to hone it, so that they might take on the role of a seer within their village. However, these efforts aren’t always met with success. The Sight will sometimes visit a cervan only once in their lifetime, with no amount of training granting a glimpse of such visions again. This is believed to be for the best, as cervans acknowledge that those who are truly Sighted carry knowledge that can be both a blessing and a curse. The Blessing of Cairith While it’s not unusual for some cervans to have small antlers or buds visible on their heads, only rarely is a cervan born who can grow a full set of antlers. These cervans are a different subrace—pronghorns—and are thought to be specially blessed by their Amaranthine Cairith, a sacred spirit of life and growth believed to watch over all cervans. Unlike other subraces, pronghorn and grove cervans are the same people. The arrival of a pronghorn cervan is an event to celebrate, as it can occur only once in a generation. Cervan Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age. Cervans reach maturity around 12 years. They live long lives compared to the rest of the Humblefolk, between 100 and 150 years, something they attribute as much to their way of life as the blessing of Cairith. Pronghorns generally live longer than grove cervans, which is considered a sign of Cairith’s favor. Alignment. Cervans are pragmatic in their thinking, and generally prefer to keep their philosophies flexible in order to prioritize what they believe is important for both themselves and their communities. They lean towards neutral alignments. Size. Grove cervans stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, and have light builds, weighing between 130 and 180 pounds. Pronghorn cervans are taller and tend toward heavier, more muscular builds, standing around 7 feet tall, and sometimes weighing over 200 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Practical. Cervans are eminently practical and like to spend their time learning useful skills for life in their woodland villages. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Athletics, Medicine, Nature, or Survival. Surge of Vigor. All cervans possess a great tenacity and will to survive, which allows them to bounce back from even the most devastating blows. If an attack deals over half of your current remaining hit points in damage, (even if your hit points are reduced to 0 by the attack) you immediately regain hit points equal to 1d12 + your Constitution Modifier. You can’t use this feature again until you have completed a long rest. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk, and speak Cervan (Cervan has no written component). Subrace. There are two main subraces of cervans: grove or pronghorn . Choose one of these subraces.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Hit Point Press","book":"Humblewood"},{"name":"Changeling","description":"With ever-changing appearances, changelings reside in many societies undetected. Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face is only a disguise. For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul. The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today—even in those changelings who have never set foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden. In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat. Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona’s previous users. Changeling Traits As a changeling, you have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Fey. Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Changeling Instincts. Thanks to your connection to the fey realm, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion. Shapechanger. As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight and can change your size between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can’t duplicate the appearance of an individual you’ve never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren’t changed by this trait.

Her rivals conspired against her and swore to kill her children. Jes begged the Sovereigns for help, but their only answer was the wind and rain. In the depths of her despair, a lonely traveler took her hand. “I will protect your children if they follow my path. Let them wander the world. They may be shunned and feared, but they will never be destroyed.” Jes agreed, and the traveler gave her his cloak. When she draped it over her children, their old faces melted away and they could be whoever they wanted to be. And so it remains. Though the children are shunned by all, the gift of the Traveler protects them still. —Chance, changeling priest Changelings can shift their forms with a thought. Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It’s also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion. A Hidden People Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known. Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, fam- ilies who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler. In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character’s relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions? Masks and Personas In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape— one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat. Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on duty will adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona’s previous users. Changeling Names A changeling might use a different name for each mask and persona and adopt new names as easily as they change faces. The true name of a changeling tends to be simple and monosyllabic; however, there are often accents to a changeling’s name that are expressed through shapeshifting, something single-skins will likely miss. So, two changelings might have the name Jin, but one is Jin-with-vivid-blue-eyes and one is Jin-with-golden-nails . Changelings have a fluid relationship with gender, see- ing it as one characteristic to change among many. Changeling Names: Aunn, Bin, Cas, Dox, Fie, Hars, Jin, Lam, Mas, Nix, Ot, Paik, Ruz, Sim, Toox, Vil, Yug Changeling Traits Your changeling character has the following traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2. In addition, one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Age. Changelings mature slightly faster than humans but share a similar lifespan—typically a century or less. While a changeling can transform to conceal their age, the effects of aging affect them similarly to humans. Alignment. Changelings tend toward pragmatic neutrality, and few changelings embrace evil.

They have been living there in small tribal communities for tens of thousands of years. During the Age of Spirits on Virthys, they slowly became the dominant race of Shamrua, but they didn't spread much beyond the borders of this region. A few smaller communities are known to exist in the Bleeding Jungles. The Chazrac are hulking reptiles with strong tails, and long arms that they often use as front legs. They walk as much on all four as they walk upright. Their species relies less on body language and other visual expression than on taste. This means that Chazrac regularly lick each other with their split blue tongues to taste each other's mood. If they learn that other species react badly to this, they try to taste the mood in the air, but it's not as precise. A Chazrac's scales can be of any colour, depending on the specific environment they grew up in. They have a light green complexion when they are born, but during the first two years, their scales take on colors that help them camouflage in their home. The tribal communities are never bigger than about fifty members. If they grow beyond that, some of the tribe's members instinctively cut ties with their home - usually to build a new community elsewhere. But in a few rare cases, these Chazrac have been known to just keep travelling. Chazrac are mostly vegetarians, with only the occasional meat to complement their diet. They live relatively simple lives in the swamps, governed by superstitions and worship of local spirits. They prefer to live isolated and avoid contact with other cultures. Most of the time, they are reclusive, yet gentle beings - unless their home or tribe is threatened. A Chazrac defending himself and his loved ones is a ferocious enemy. When the apocalypse hit Virthys, most Chazrac simply tried to hide, praying to local swamp spirits for help. Only a few individuals felt they had to fight, leaving their homes to protect their loved ones. After the creation of Ashandri, the influence of hags on the Shamruan swamps has become stronger. Some of the lizards despise them so much that they actively fight them. But there are also rumors about a few tribes corrupted by the hags. Culture The Chazrac society is shaped mostly by the rules of survival. Many of their superstitions are based on real experiences - only the explanations are wrong. For example, a Chazrac might believe you have to stomp on the ground before setting up camp to drive out evil spirits. In reality, this scares off venomous snakes in some areas of Shamrua. Some of these beliefs are also tied to actual nature spirits - but the Chazrac stick to offer gifts to these spirits even if they're far from home, out of the area of influence of such spirits. The family and the tribe is everything to a Chazrac. Even those who leave their tribes still feel deep love for their clans and native homelands. They are less driven by ethics than by personal bonds. While Chazrac themselves are rarely evil, they do not always mind the company of malicious people. As long as their companions treat them and their friends well, it's their business how they treat others. Names The Chazrac didn't have a written language for thousands of years. Only about three hundred years ago, they learned these skills from other races. Chazrac words are written as they sound, which means every tribe writes things slightly differently. The entire language is based on one- and two-syllable words, and this is true for Chazrac names, as well. These words are either written together, or connected by a dash or apostrophe - there are no real grammar rules for this. The Chazrac have no family names. Instead, the lizards identify by their clan, such as Tchi-Zi of the Snakeswamp Tribe or Maki of the Brownscales. Male names often include hard consonants as \"k\" or \"p\", while female names often have at least one \"i\" or \"e\" as a vocal. Both male and females names often have one or several \"s\" and \"z\" letters. Male Chazrac names: Okriz, Sassik, Azq, Pyazun, Zrak-Thi, Cav'Zan, Tchi Female Chazrac names: Irriz, Semizz, Phi, Ai'cez, Ziph-Ssa, Syiga, Azzil Anatomy Chazrac are a race of cold-blooded lizards that can walk upright on two feet, or as quadrupeds, using their arms as front legs. They are muscular, about eight to nine feet tall, and have thick scales. Their scales, each about the size of a human fingernail, adapt their colours to their environment during the first two years of their life. As they live in swamps, most of them have green or yellow scales, but in the diverse environment of their homelands, a lot of different colours are known, as well. Even in upright position, their backs are slightly curved forward. Their hands only have four fingers each. The Chazrac have long blue tongues. Their eyes are placed on the sides of the head, with black pupils that are either round or, rarely, star-shaped. Their eye colours often match the colours of their scales, with green and yellow colours being predominant. Traits Ability Score Increase: Strength+2, Wisdom+1 Age: Chazrac have a slow metabolism, granting them a relatively long life. Under ideal conditions, these lizards can grow up to 200 years old. Lacking many of the comforts of civilization, though, many Chazrac do not live beyond 60 years. They mature at about 14 years. Alignment: Many Chazrac have a very neutral perspective on life. A few of them feel towards almost the entire world as they feel towards their tribes, though. These deeply caring Chazrac have a strong tendency towards good. Others believe in the survival of the strongest, and embraced evil. Size: An upright Chazrac is about 8-9 feet tall. If they walk on all four, they are about 5-7 feet tall. Their size category is medium. Languages: Chazrac can speak, read, and write their own language, and they have learned Common - mostly to tell other species to go away. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Thick Scales: Chazrac have a base armor class of 12. Tail Strike: Your tail is a natural weapon, and you can make unarmed strikes with it. On a hit, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the damage normal for an Unarmed Strike.

Chromatic Dragonborn Traits You have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size . You are Medium. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Chromatic Ancestry. You have a chromatic dragon ancestor, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one kind of dragon from the Chromatic Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits, as shown in the table. Breath Weapon. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

Metal shrieking against metal, boots pulling from the muck, a rallying call strangled with fear. If they’d just been faster— “Captain.” Her lieutenant, Cian, is more insistent. Captain Jivanna drags her eyes from the wreckage to follow his gaze. “What? I already told you, leave them behi—” “Look.” Cian gestures to a solitary figure that descends on the massacre of bodies and beasts. Murky wings of water fold into the figure’s back as they crouch over a soldier whose breath rattles in cold resignation. He draws a blade with bloodied hands. “Get off them! We have to take their body ba—” Jivanna seizes his wrist, her eyes on the figure. “Leave them. They’re in the hands of a ferrier now.” Chthonic scions are called to the most solemn of all tasks: easing the traversal from life to death. Found in warzones, dungeons, rebel battlefields, and at the gates of unholy necropoli, these angelic ferriers prevent undue death, defy necromantic evil, ease the suffering of the dying, and soothe the fear of what comes after. Solemn Ferrymen Chthonic scions are subtle by nature. Theirs is no calling of glory, power, or triumph—they are often quiet presences, notable as celestial inheritors only when they display their full wingspan or in the moments before a creature’s death. A chthonic scion is an overseer of passing souls: they possess the ability to take on a visage of comfort. Their voice, frame, and face adopt features a creature finds comforting in its final moments, and return to their original form when the soul has passed. A small-town farmgirl may see an elderly, maternal figure whose voice croaks comfortingly like the village elders she knew, while a soldier or a mercenary may find a weathered combatant easing their final moments, offering camaraderie and strength. These ferriers’ wings are not splendorous, but made of shifting materials that a dying creature finds familiar. Creatures from druidic cultures may find that their ferriers appear with wings of leaves or blossoms, while creatures from a seafaring culture may see their ferrier with wings of water or brewing storm clouds. Soul Shepherds and Adventuring Many chthonic scions become clerics, druids, and rangers, drawing on their connections to the planes, the natural cycles of life and death, and the healing and peace that can be administered through magic. But more than anything, successfully fulfilling your role as a ferrier requires empathy—something suited for any class. A solemn fighter knows how to protect those who have more yet to do and how to peacefully end those whose lives are over. A chronicling bard may write the stories of those they help pass on as a way to remember them. There are many ways for a ferrier to do their job respectfully and sincerely. Notably, however, many chthonic scions are drawn to practice magic, finding a natural curiosity in studying the soul. What a soul is, where it comes from, where it goes, why it seems to be the strongest well of a person’s power—these are questions magic seeks to answer. And chthonic scions have great interest in understanding the soul. When a creature dies, the chthonic scion is one of the only beings able to physically hold the tangible manifestation of their soul and direct it forth. Many of these scions travel with adventurers, studying the souls they come across and the different mortal understandings of souls. Adventuring ferriers try to determine their place in the multiverse as one of the only beings allowed to touch a soul. Sacred Death Chthonic scions need only do one thing to earn the ire of their Celestial connections: defile death. Given a solemn charge over the passage from life to afterlife, ferriers are granted an enormous amount of trust, and expected to embody kindness, empathy, and calm. They can’t betray this trust without devastating consequences. Chthonic scions who turn to ruthlessness, cruel apathy, and death-tainting magics find themselves swiftly hunted by vindicator scions or other divine beings. However, most ferriers have a deep disdain for necromancy and undeath, as it interferes with their work and defiles the dead, keeping them from finding peace. Chthonic Scion Traits Your chthonic scion has the following traits. Ability Score Increase Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Age Chthonic scions mature at the same rate as humans, but they can live up to 150 years. Alignment As silent wardens of the dying, chthonic scions prioritize respect and empathy above all else. They tend toward lawful or neutral good. Requiem of the Fallen When a creature with a soul dies within 60 feet of you, you can catch in its soul and keep it with you in a small container. You can’t collect another soul until you finish a long rest, and you can only keep one soul this way at a time. During a long rest, you can ritually connect with the soul, drawing on your connection with death to ask it up to three questions. Speaking with the soul does not require that you share a common language, but the soul is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. You can keep the soul for as long as you want, but it will only answer three questions in total. When you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can release this soul to gain advantage on the check. Dying without Dying Some creatures don’t die when reduced to 0 hit points. Fiends, for instance, return to their plane of origin when reduced to 0 hit points on the Material Plane. If a chthonic scion tries to take a soul from a devil or a demon, they may instead find that the soul vanished back to the Hells along with the creature. Of course, in your game’s world, perhaps fiends and other such creatures die permanently. Talk to your GM about the chthonic scion’s Requiem of the Fallen trait and make sure you have an understanding of which creatures die when reduced to 0 hit points. If you’re a GM with a chthonic scion in your group, ensure that the character gets to use this trait frequently enough to be satisfying. Sentinel’s Denial Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing shadows to deepen and stretch about you as a chill wind stirs the air. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. For the duration, you have a flying speed of 30 feet, and once on each of your turns, you can deal additional necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The additional necrotic damage equals your level. In addition, once per turn when you successfully hit with an attack or a spell, one unconscious creature within 30 feet of you of your choice automatically succeeds on a death saving throw. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"MCDM Productions","book":"Arcadia Issue No. 11"},{"name":"Cnidaran","description":"“Don’t. Break. The. Coral. No souvenirs, no trinkets, no keepsakes. That’s someone’s grandparent.” - Jack Kusto, Oceanographer From nomadic, floating cities whose coral exoskeletons stretch down into the dark ocean depths to mile-long reefs and small atolls, cnidaran (NI-da-ran) settlements can be found wherever salt meets water. Their unique, bipartite lifecycle sets them apart from most other humanoids and fosters a zealous loyalty between cnidaran and home. Disperse and Deploy Cnidarans have two distinct phases to their lifecycle: the medusozoa and the polyp. An adventuring cnidaran—one that can speak, has a vaguely humanoid shape, and can manipulate tools—is a medusozoa. These individuals are responsible for interacting with the outside world (in other words, anything beyond their home reef). When medusozoa mate, an event that can involve dozens of individuals, the thousands of larvae that are conceived settle on the nearest substrate, often the cnidarans’ own coral home. Once rooted, the larvae develop into polyps with two tasks. The first is to grow a single new medusozoa over a single moon’s cycle and then birth this inch-long, instinct-driven youngster into the waters surrounding its home. The second is to secrete a calcareous exoskeleton, fusing their body with the reef and growing the cnidarans’ coral home. Life for a young medusozoa is tenuous; it must fend for itself, drifting in open waters and feeding on plankton and other medusozoa until it reaches at least a foot in length, usually by the end of its third year. During this juvenile stage, a time known as the uko’ulush (the ‘wild time’), a medusozoa is largely ignored by other cnidarans, who believe that “trial by ocean makes the hardest pearls. ” Once a cnidaran completes this juvenile stage, it is brought into the reef, a utilitarian and communal space where the customs, culture, and values of that reef are passed on, the uko’malang (the ‘time of waiting’). Commune and Community Cnidarans live communally. With the practices of mass mating and random dispersal, no single medusozoa knows which individuals are their parents. In fact, the entire concept of ‘parentage’, ‘hereditary titles’, and ‘inheritance’ is foreign to most cnidarans. When a cnidaran medusozoa reaches maturity, it is given the choice to leave the reef with the blessing of the whole community, a once-in-a-lifetime event known as the uko’fa (the ‘time of exploration’). Individuals that start on the uko’fa do so for a multitude of reasons. Some seek to bring back treasures from the world beyond and enhance their own community. Others feel a need to disperse, finding other reefs to join or even forming new reefs with like-minded medusozoa met on their travels. A very few become enraptured by wanderlust and spend the rest of their days among winding ocean currents, delving into damp dungeons, and cavorting in ports with other seadogs. No Place Like Home Cnidaran settlements are alive. Made of the bodies of millions of calcified polyps—cnidaran ancestors—a reef is more than just a home; it is the collective memory of a thousand generations, a traceable web of genealogical history, and an esteemed and holy sanctuary. Intentionally damaging a reef carries grave consequences: death, exile, or declarations of war are all sanctions a cnidaran colony might employ. It isn’t unusual for trade unions to pay handsome reparations if a ship damages a cnidaran reef when blown off course by wild winds. To do otherwise might result in ships foundering even in fair and pleasant conditions, such is the whim of an enraged cnidaran reef. Cnidaran Traits As a cnidaran, you have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Constitution score increases by 1. Age .

You can breathe air and water. Subrace. When a polyp produces a medusozoa, it can birth one of two morphs: a nematocyst or a shimmerskin. The former is adapted for confrontation, combat, and conflict; and carries with it an innately toxic weapon. The latter relies on diplomacy, subterfuge, and enchantment to charm antagonists and avoid conflict. Together, these two morphs are capable of pursuing two very different strategies in interspecies interactions. Choose one of these subraces.

These Large humanoids have massive arms and walk on their knuckles. Long, oily hair adorns their stone-chiseled heads, hands, and feet. Their dusty skin is marbled, mixed with the primary minerals of their five birth parents. Coalders came about as the plane's response to the tarrasque. They can withstand the harshest environments and stay close to the monster to keep it sated and asleep, knowing that if they fail, the world could be devoured. Their existence is so entwined with the tarrasque that some coalders worship it as a god. Coalder society reveres the concept of fuel, the will to keep going, knowing full well that catastrophe could destroy them at any moment. They fuel their communities with acts of service and their loved ones with gifts, believing that their fuel will spark them to lead bright-burning and exciting lives. Dwarves and stone giants that share this ideal sometimes live among coalders, working together to keep their world and home thriving. A coalder adventurer typically has two good reasons for leaving home. They need something to help quell the tarrasque, or they want to get far, far away from it.

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Age .

Their reputation in birdfolk society is nothing short of villainous, and they are regularly cast as the antagonists of any given situation. It’s hard to say whether the corvums are distrusted because they behave the way they do, or if they behave the way they do because they are distrusted. For Personal Gain It is widely believed that corvums only look out for themselves. Sometimes this presents as flexible morals, and at other times it simply means they follow a personal code instead of subscribing to general law. Either way, corvums are a crafty race and they tend to get what they want, one way or another. Corvums are typically found in positions with a modicum of power, such as advisors or minor officials. The stigma they face usually prevents them from attaining too prominent a position in birdfolk society, but corvums are adept at working behind the scenes, spreading their influence subtly and to great effect. Too Smart Corvums are commonly accepted, sometimes begrudgingly, to be among the smartest of birdfolk. Keen observers, they trade in information the way others trade goods. They are hungry for knowledge and leverage it to further their goals whenever possible. Their undeniable skill in matters of logistics and planning make them valuable to councils and powerful individuals alike. Corvum Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Age. Corvums reach adulthood at around 18 years. They live slightly shorter lives than other birdfolk, approximately 70 years. Alignment. Shrewd and capable, corvums prefer moral flexibility and are more likely to be neutral than either good or evil. Nonetheless, corvums see the benefit of rules, even if many attempt to turn them to their own advantage. Because of this they favor lawful alignments. Size. Corvums cut imposing figures, standing between 4 and a half and 5 and a half feet tall, encompassing a variety of different builds. They weigh around 100 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Glide. Using your feathered arms, you can slow your fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose, although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you are encumbered. Talons. Your sharp claws aid you in unarmed combat and while climbing. Your damage for an unarmed strike is 1d4 piercing damage. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb any surface your talons could reasonably grip. Learned. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Appraising Eye. You have an almost supernatural ability to appraise objects. By spending an action examining any object, you can determine any magical properties the item has, how they might be used or activated, as well as a fair estimation of market price. Using this skill strains the eyes, and you must complete a long or short rest before you can use it again. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk. You can also understand Auran, though you cannot speak it naturally. Subrace. There are two main subraces of corvum: dusk and kindled .

From the moment of their birth, they are each adorned with a quiescent mask, sealing their features in a permanent expression of cold, unfeeling marble. Nevertheless, these fated beings find strength in the familial bonds that tie them together, for they must rely on each other to survive the foul scourge that has befallen Luyarnha. Alas, the cursed-blood are shunned and abhorred throughout the city-state, only finding refuge far from the prying eyes of society, amidst the squalor of the city's slums. In these desolate corners, where madness and scourge ravage the populace, the cursed-blood stand vigilant, ever protective of their own kin, finding solace in their shared bane. The cursed-bloods’ origins are viewed as a taboo subject not to be spoken of by the populace, to avoid incurring the wrath of those above. According to whispered rumors, the curse was a punishment meted out by vengeful Great Ones, a retribution for sins committed by their forebears. Once, their kin—demons, dragons, and other creatures of flame and brimstone—roamed freely across the world, but they have long since disappeared, banished from existence by the enigmatic beings that lurk in the glacial void beyond. Now, all who share even a drop of their blood are condemned to a wretched existence, their individual origins erased and replaced by the familial bond they forged from the crucible of their affliction. This curse, wrought from birth, is both tragic and horrific. Each born as conjoined twins, one of them must inevitably perish for the other to live. Although the death of their twin happens in the womb, the cursed-blood can still hear and feel the echoes of their lost sibling's voice within their own soul. This unspeakable atrocity against life twists their flesh and soul, and forces them to carry the remnants of their other half within their chest in the form of a gaping maw, an eye, or some other feature over which they have no control. Cursed-Blood Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1 and one ability score of your choice increases by 1. Age. Cursed-bloods develop much faster than humans, reaching maturity after 5 years, and have shorter lifespans, passing after roughly 60 years, though some rare individuals have lived up to 100. Alignment. Though reviled since birth, most cursed-bloods strive toward lawful and good behavior, willing to sacrifice everything for their family. Yet, some cursed-bloods develop a nihilistic hatred for all life, reinforced by the utterances of their conjoined corpse. Size. Cursed-bloods average about 4 feet tall and weigh about 100 pounds, with elongated limbs and necks. Your size is Small. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet and you have a climbing speed of 25 feet. You can't use your climbing speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and your choice of either Draconic or Infernal (choose when you select this race). Vigilant Nature. Your survival instincts are sharper than most. You can’t be surprised. On a turn when you would be surprised, you can’t attack or cast spells that affect enemies. Conjoined Twin. Your dead twin manifests on your body in one of the following ways of your choice: Chest Maw. The mouth on your abdomen can devour many things, temporarily storing them in a pocket dimension within you. It can hold up to 250 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 32 cubic feet. If you fall unconscious or die, you harmlessly regurgitate all materials in your maw. Breathing creatures inside your maw can survive up to 1 minute, after which time they begin to suffocate. After 24 hours inside your body, a nonmagical item is destroyed, consumed by your body. If it is a magic item, a creature, or a corpse, you regurgitate it instead. Starting at 5th level, you can store materials indefinitely (but still not while unconscious or dead), and the dimension’s volume and weight it can hold doubles. Heedful Eye. As long as the eye in your chest is open, you have darkvision out to 120 feet. You can cast detect magic once while the eye is open, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 5th level, you can cast see invisibility once while the eye is open, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can open the eye as a bonus action, and close it at will (no action required). Gaping Remain. Ripped out of your chest, due to your will or perhaps your twin’s, it now only exists within you in spirit, capable of influencing the world through you. You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see, provided the creature is within a number of feet of you equal to five times your level. The voice the creature hears isn’t yours, but that of your twin. The telepathic speech is made in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Starting at 5th level, the creature is able to telepathically respond to you in a language it knows. You learn the mage hand cantrip. You can cast it without any somatic or verbal components, and the hand has the appearance of your twin’s. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is Charisma. Subrace. Although all cursed-bloods view each other as family, depending on their origin—draconic, infernal, or otherwise—their flesh has evolved in various ways, which represent their subrace.

Doused Hulking Mirage","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"MonkeyDM","book":"Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt"},{"name":"Cyclopian","description":"“Okay, ready? Left eye. Right eye. Left eye. Righ- oh I do beg your pardon.” - Sia Lotta’ize, Opthamolagist The pursuit of knowledge, the acquisition of secrets, and the hoarding of trinkets with storied histories are common practices among any creature raised by cyclopians (sy-CLO-pee-ans). From dog tags to tapestries, musical manuscripts to carved tablets, and magical memory orbs to worthless heirlooms, their ‘libraries’ (as cyclopians refer to their homes) are filled with knowledge. With their physical adaptation to climbing, cyclopian homes are often found high up in cliffsides, within abandoned wizards’ towers, or deep in The Low. Monocular and Myopic A cyclopian’s singular eye is the perfect metaphor for this race’s almost-myopic tendency to focus on one thing to the exclusion of all others. When a cyclopian finds a topic that interests them, little can stop their manic and feverish efforts to acquire any relevant documents, information, or answers. Indeed, the famed cyclopian researcher Roza “Thanks” Thanklinds is rumoured to have forgone sleep for more than two months while analysing the crystallised mut-x from the former laboratory of Dr Frank N. Stein. Of course, this feat was made all the easier thanks to cyclopians’ ability to metabolise knowledge into actual, physical, nutritional value. Arcanists Analogue Cyclopians are often mistaken for shadowy aberrations of the Shadow Plane known as nothings. While both cyclopian and nothings share a hulking monocular physiology and a hunger for knowledge, a brief observation yields one significant difference: the skulking simulacra leave a trail of rot and necrosis wherever they travel, while no true cyclopian would ever risk damaging a book in this way. Pilgrimage of Huge Discovery Cyclopians of a certain age often embark on a Pilgrimage of Huge Discovery, or PHD. During this time, they venture out into the world, seeking to bring new and significant knowledge back to their library. For some individuals, the natural compulsion to explore is all the impetus they need to leave the comfort of their homes. On the other hand, more reticent cyclopians might have to be forced out by their family, fulfilling this rite of passage based on a sense of duty. Cyclopians who fixate on the acquisition of artifacts, rather than the joy of studying them, are regarded as rare and valuable assets to any family; cyclopian adventurers are always warmly welcomed back to their library. Sharing is Caring Cyclopians have an unusual lifecycle. Though they can reproduce sexually, cyclopians are also capable of a form of asexual budding. When a cyclopian is beyond inundated by the volume of knowledge awaiting its analysis (such as after it gains entry into an abandoned, book-filled wizard’s tower), it can spontaneously and unexpectedly undergo entire body mitosis. This produces a smaller, similar, genetically distinct, individual—an assistant with whom the research can be more manageably catalogued. Cyclopian Traits As a cyclopian, you have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and either your Dexterity score or Wisdom score increases by 1 (your choice). Age . Cyclopians reach maturity in their early teens and typically live as long as humans. Creature Type . You are a humanoid. You are also considered an aberration for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an aberration. Languages . You can speak, read, and write Common, Undercommon, and one other language of your choice. Size . With their crouched and hulking posture, Cyclopians typically appear smaller than they are. At full stretch, a cyclopian stands between 5 and 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet . Darkvision . Accustomed to life in dimly-lit libraries, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey. Knowledge Seeker . Learning is an almost irresistible compulsion amongst cyclopians and often leads them to dangerous locations. You have proficiency in your choice of two of the following skills: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, Religion, and Stealth. Savant of Secrets . You can tap into your ancestral ability to spot the telltale signs of hidden traps, passages, and secrets. As an action, you can enter a cyclotrance for 1 minute . For the duration, you have advantage on Perception, Investigation, and Insight checks. Once you activate this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Thought for Food . Information is nourishing for cyclopians, in the truest sense of the word. Each day that you discover significant new information (GM’s discretion), you need only half as much food and water as normal and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws . These benefits last until you finish a long rest. Top Shelf . Generations spent climbing to the top shelves of tall libraries have led to a selective pressure on the ability to climb within cyclopians.

Its citizens call themselves the People, but the rest of Midgard calls them the Lords Subterranean, the Ghoul Imperium, or simply the Empire of the Ghouls. Their cities lie out of sight, their agents infiltrate the underworlds of a score of surface cities, and their goals know no limits. To them, if you are not a member of the People, you are food. Their empire maintains complex social structures and forges serious alliances, particularly among the undead princes of Morgau and Doresh. Unofficial embassies exist in Zobeck, the Ironcrag Cantons, Krakova, and Magdar. Other hidden outposts may lurk below the Seven Cities, Illyria, or beyond. They scheme and plot. They hunger for the flesh of the living. They are the darakhul. Playing a Darakhul Character Life as the ravenous undead comes with challenges for an adventurer. People revile the darakhul universally as scavengers at best and as loathsome, murdering abominations at worst. For such a being, participating as a member of an adventuring party is complicated. To survive on the daylit surface of the world, a darakhul must be clever and thorough. One of the touchstones that provides stability in your new form is your old life. While you have urges and thoughts that are dark and terrible, memories and feelings from your life before undeath might resurface to help you cope. Sometimes these flashes are corrupted versions of your old self, manifesting in your mind in new ways. Other times the recollections and feelings bubble up unfiltered, reminding you of a time when you were alive. Both are painful, but pain can be instructive. A major question you have to answer when you play a darakhul is, “How am I dealing with the change that transformed me into a ghoul?” Have you fully accepted your new situation, embracing your new powers and hungers as a boon? Do you fight against your urges daily, seeking to return to your old self? What were your goals before your transformation, and do you still pursue them? Are your new goals simply about survival, or are those aspirations a twisted reflection of the goals you had as a living creature? Regardless of your current monstrous state, who you once were has a powerful effect on who you are now. The carefree spirit of a halfling, the fiendish urges of a tiefling, or the creative spark of a gnome: all of these do not leave you simply because of your new form. How do those traits manifest themselves in your now? There is a great deal of narrative, dramatic, and roleplaying potential in that tension between the old self and the new. Darakhul may be undead, but they still must function in their own society—be it on the surface or in the Underworld. Most still have jobs to do and dreams to fulfill within their society. Into the Big, Wide World Some darakhul venture into the wider world on the business of the Imperium. Maintaining their state requires envoys and ambassadors, messengers and scouts, traders and commerce, as well as knowledge of events in the surface world. These undead diplomats engage with races they might otherwise consider food out of duty to the Imperium and with a specific purpose. Other members of their kind, however, have no such obligations. For adventuring darakhul, those in self-imposed exile, or those who never belonged to the Imperium, the quest to master their own hunger, to transcend their role as predators of sentient beings, is as much a part of their journey as the current quest. These characters typically want to grow beyond their ghoulish appetites and regain some part of their former lives in the cultures and societies of the world’s surface. No one knows better than the darakhul that they can’t overcome their nature unless they confront it. But no matter how urbane or well-controlled the rare diplomat or merchant might seem to be, the prejudice of the living against the undead is powerful and visceral. Humanity views the darakhul with suspicion if not outright hostility, and it is difficult—but not impossible—for a darakhul to allay those fears. The Cut of Your Cloak A quality disguise is one of the best tools for a darakhul trying to make its way among the breathing. Almost all ghouls traveling on the surface maintain a disguise kit and a concealing outfit to match their cover identity. With a good costume, a ghoul might pass unchallenged among humans for a long time. Possibilities include the wrappings of a leper, the enshrouding robes that are common within the Magocracy of Allain, the veils of Siwali ladies, or the head-to-toe garb of the desert raiders of the Tamasheq. Each of these disguises requires appropriate details to help the deception withstand scrutiny: the right language skills along with knowledge of the region and its customs. Even a convincing disguise doesn’t explain a darakhul’s need to eat alone and behind closed doors. Darakhul can use cultural or religious requirements to justify such behavior in most situations. In cases where a costume and a cover identity are impractical, a skillful application of cosmetics and a few gold coins slipped into the right hands are often enough to make a request for privacy seem more reasonable. Ensuring a sufficient supply of raw meat is a challenge left to the darakhul’s imagination. Darakhul Characters Both ordinary ghouls and darakhul arise from the infected corpses of other races. Most traits of the previous race are gone, although every darakhul carries some trait of their previous form (see the Heritage Subraces). Even their cosmetic features, such as supple skin and long beards, fade over time into the gaunt, skull-like faces, fanged maws and taut, gray skin of the ghouls. Darakhul Traits Your darakhul character has certain characteristics in common with all other darakhul. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1. Age. An upper limit of darakhul age has never been discovered; most darakhul die violently. Alignment. Your alignment does not change when you become a darakhul, but most darakhul have a strong draw toward evil. Size. Your size is determined by your Heritage Subrace Speed. Your base walking speed is determined by your Heritage Subrace. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet as though it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Hunger for Flesh. You must consume 1 pound of raw meat each day or suffer the effects of starvation. If you go 24 hours without such a meal, you gain one level of exhaustion. While you have any levels of exhaustion from this trait, you can’t regain hit points or remove levels of exhaustion until you spend at least 1 hour consuming 10 pounds of raw meat. Imperfect Undeath. You transitioned into undeath, but your transition was imperfect. Though you are a humanoid, you are susceptible to effects that target undead. You can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds, but you can also be affected by game effects that specifically target undead, such as a cleric’s Turn Undead feature. Game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, but they return you to life as a darakhul. A true resurrection or wish spell can restore you to life as a fully living member of your original race. Powerful Jaw. Your heavy jaw is powerful enough to crush bones to powder. Your bite is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. Undead Resilience. You are infused with the dark energy of undeath, which frees you from some frailties that plague most creatures. You have resistance to necrotic damage and poison damage, you are immune to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and poisoned. When you finish a short rest, you can reduce your exhaustion level by 1, provided you have ingested at least 1 pound of raw meat in the last 24 hours (see Hunger for Flesh). Undead Vitality. You don’t need to breathe, and you don’t sleep the way most creatures do. Instead, you enter a dormant state that resembles death, remaining semiconscious, for 6 hours a day. While dormant, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Darakhul, and a language associated with your Heritage Subrace. Heritage Subrace. You were something else before you became a darakhul. This heritage determines some of your traits. Choose one Heritage Subrace below and apply the listed traits. Looking Alive To pass for a living creature, a darakhul needs a convincing costume, matching language and speech patterns, and appropriate mannerisms and behavior. The best tactic for most darakhul is to mimic the cultures they lived in while alive, because they have a lifetime (if a short one) of knowledge to draw on. Whether it’s better to try to blend into the local culture is an open question. Someone who looks just like everyone else on the street draws less attention than someone who looks like an exotic foreigner—but a person who looks like everyone else yet acts oddly can rouse even more suspicion than the exotic stranger, especially in a crossroads of cultures where foreign travelers are common. Under normal circumstances, a darakhul with a careful disguise can move among the living without rousing suspicion. As with any ability check, dice should be brought in only when the character faces an unusual situation or a challenge. If, for example, a darakhul gets involved in a chase or a battle in a crowded city market, there’s a chance a bystander might notice the pallor of undead flesh beneath a flapping cloak or the rictus grin inside a deep hood that’s momentarily pushed back. Palace guards inspect supplicants to the Queen more carefully than an innkeeper or a merchant inspects customers. If rumors get around that there are murderers, monsters, or darakhul loose in the city, everyone is more alert. In those situations, the GM can call for a Charisma (Deception) check and either compare it to the NPC’s passive Perception score or make an active Wisdom (Perception) check for the NPC. Opposed checks should be reserved for those times when an NPC intently scrutinizes the character or is already suspicious. If a group of NPCs is involved, it’s best to make one check with advantage for the group instead of one check per NPC. Heritage Subraces Before the terrible scourge of darakhul fever transformed you into an undead creature, you belonged to another race. Although your undead self now rules you, some remnant of your past form clings to you, making you different from the darakhul created from another race. Sometimes you retain a trait, but more likely you now have a trait that is a corruption of one you once possessed. For example, the elemental spark in a dragonborn is perverted into one of a more necrotic bent. The luck inherent in a halfling’s spirit twists into a power that brings ill fortune to their enemies.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Underworld Player's Guide"},{"name":"Darakhul","description":"In the lightless depths beneath the ground, an empire of devouring ambition grows and plots and dreams.

Playing a Darakhul Character Life as the ravenous undead comes with challenges for an adventurer. People revile the darakhul universally as scavengers at best and as loathsome, murdering abominations at worst. For such a being, participating as a member of an adventuring party is complicated. To survive on the daylit surface of the world, a darakhul must be clever and thorough. One of the touchstones that provides stability in your new form is your old life. While you have urges and thoughts that are dark and terrible, memories and feelings from your life before undeath might resurface to help you cope. Sometimes these flashes are corrupted versions of your old self, manifesting in your mind in new ways. Other times the recollections and feelings bubble up unfiltered, reminding you of a time when you were alive. Both are painful, but pain can be instructive. A major question you have to answer when you play a darakhul is, “How am I dealing with the change that transformed me into a darakhul?” Have you fully accepted your new situation, embracing your new powers and hungers as a boon? Do you fight against your urges daily, seeking to return to your old self? What were your goals before your transformation, and do you still pursue them? Are your new goals simply about survival, or are those aspirations a twisted reflection of the goals you had as a living creature? Regardless of your current monstrous state, who you once were has a powerful effect on who you are now. The carefree spirit of a halfling, the fiendish urges of a tiefling, or the creative spark of a gnome: all of these do not leave you simply because of your new form. How do those traits manifest themselves in your now? There is a great deal of narrative, dramatic, and roleplaying potential in that tension between the old self and the new. Darakhul may be undead, but they still must function in their own society—be it on the surface or in the empires beneath the surface.

They have grown into a powerful force. Living flesh is scarce in the Shadow Realm, so while the darakhul still hunt the living denizens of the plane and maintain elaborate trade networks to secure living cargo from mortal lands, they have discovered that the crackling trees—an invasive species originating in Evermaw—can assuage much of their hunger, and they have learned to subsist on the blood-like sap drawn from these trees. This practice marks them though, for the corruption inherent in the flora causes a permanent blackening of the teeth, recession of the gums, and shriveling of the flesh around the mouth. As a result, the darakhul of the Shadow Realm are much less concerned with concealing their true nature. After all, they are far from the worst things that stalk the darkness. In addition to the heritage subrace options presented in Tome of Heroes , a darakhul character from the Shadow Realm can choose one of the options below. Darakhul Names Ghouls tend to keep their first names from their time among the living. Their surnames, however, tend to be granted or chosen by the newly arrived darakhul after the Crossing (their passage into undeath). These are sometimes the name of a patron, lord, or lady, or a name used within the legions of the empire or within a particular faith. Some common lineage names are provided below. Some names are most common in the priesthoods while others are from the legions. Outside of those areas, surnames often celebrate particular affiliations in the trades or mark a tie to a founder of particular note. Because of this naming custom, different darakhul can end up with the same surname due to being chosen by the same patron, being part of the same temple, being the spawn of another darakhul, or some other similar circumstance. Ghouls created outside the influence of the Twilight Empire might take on surnames related to their personal goals, keep their original surnames if attempting to regain some semblance of their previous life, or forgo a surname to avoid ties to the past, a church, or a patron. Darakhul Surnames of the Priesthood: Al-Mot, Al-Qaan, Akma-aldan, Bloodtide, Vardeson. Darakhul Surnames of the Legions: Bonecracker, Ivory, Maggot, Mortus, Reaver, Secondus.

These once grand merchants perpetrated a sin – coveting that which was not rightfully theirs – and for this dereliction of morality, they begot a curse of unspeakable malevolence, condemning their blood to the compelled service of He Who Lies Dreaming. His Blessing. Their very nature was irrevocably altered, much like those who dwell beneath the fathomless depths of the ocean; relinquished was their mortality, traded for the cold embrace of eternal slavery. They would never perish, but instead live out their days alongside He who had walked the earth long before the advent of humankind and would endure their demise for wretched ages, forever bound as pawns in the insidious machinations of their infinite master. Their tragic fate – wrought by their own rapacious avarice – is the exorbitant price they paid for their crime, and one they cannot escape. Deceptive Appearance. This curse has warped their flesh, normally so averse to magic, and created within them gates of eldritch arcane, imparting them with the peculiar ability to cloak their twisted forms, using illusions that can deceive even the keenest adventurers into seeing them as bona fide dwarves. Accursed Immortality. Despite possessing full control of their mental faculty from a young age, their physical form twists and contorts as the impossible weight of the gift of the Slumbering One scrapes them minute after minute. Their once sturdy limbs warp and bend in grotesque fashion, their eyes become sunken and hollow, and their skin takes on a sickly gray pallor. The sanity of their younger days begins to slip away, leaving them at the mercy of His malevolent dreams and to dwell within their once dwarven flesh. This destiny – a fate more dreadful than death – is something that their aging mind anticipates with glee. Deep One Dwarf Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1. Aberration. Your creature type is aberration, rather than humanoid. Age. Deep One Dwarves mature much faster than humans, reaching maturity at the age of 10. They cannot die of old age; instead their aging mind progressively loses grip over their body, turning them into brainless servants of He Who Lies Dreaming when they reach 50 years of age. Size. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet and you have a swimming speed of 25 feet. Otherworldly Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against cold damage. Illusory Body. Although your body is covered in tentacles, clams, seashells, and other eldritch appendages, you are covered by an illusion which makes you appear like a normal hill dwarf to others. You can use an action to turn this illusion on or off. Other Deep Ones can see through this illusion. Sailor Training. You have proficiency with cleavers, tridents, and firearms. Amphibious. You can breathe air and water. Cosmic Knowledge. Whenever you make a History check related to the origin of an eldritch item or construction, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. Guiding Light. You know the dancing lights cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting modifier for the spell. The Dreamer's Curse. Your mind is clouded by the dreams of the Slumbering One, and you find it hard to discern between reality and dream. You have disadvantage on saving throws against illusions. Fathomless Limb. Your body has been altered beyond recognition by the Slumbering One, giving you one of the following body alterations: Coiling Arm. Your arm is nothing but a writhing mass of tentacles that flail the air. On your turn, after hitting an enemy with a melee attack, you can attempt to grapple them as a bonus action (normal grappling restrictions apply). Brutal Pincers. Your forearm –a massive pincer– is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. If you are targeting a creature you are grappling, the damage die becomes a d10 instead. You cannot use this arm to make any precise hand manipulation. Mucoid Extremities. Your hands and feet are palmed and covered in cups. Your swimming speed increases to 30 feet, and you gain a climbing speed of 20 feet. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Deep Speech, and Dwarvish. The Dreamer's Gifts (Optional Trait at the GM’s Discretion). Your devotion to the cosmic being that warped your species is rewarded. Starting at level 5, you gain the following benefits: Whenever you fail an ability check or saving throw, you can draw upon your master’s powers to succeed instead.

Born of a union between humanoids and eldritch beings, demidritch are often referred to as ‘half-angels’, a misnomer arising from Luyarnhians’ mistaken belief that these creatures are descended from celestials. Stories abound of radiant silhouettes—eldritch creatures wreathed in powerful illusions—appearing unto pregnant Luyarnhians and blessing their progeny with otherworldly powers. While the Radiant Church espouses no stance on the morality of such beings, elements amongst their ranks, most notably the bookish Obitus Scholare, prize the demidritch as precious specimens that may provide the key to humanity's survival. The deeds of the righteous demidritch Aitzaz, a first hunter and close friend of Steinhardt, are widely recounted by bards and minstrels across the city. His death at the hands of the ravenous scourge while evacuating schoolchildren precipitated a shift in the treatment of demidritch by Luyarnhians. Though they may have otherworldly origins, the alignment of demidritch, like most humanoids, is a product of their environment and upbringing. Within the walls of Luyarnha a statue of the righteous demidritch Aitzaz was built by hunters to honor his heroic sacrifice. Origin The act of childbearing is, in itself, a heroic endeavor that women courageously undertake, placing their bodies at risk to ensure the perpetuation of their lineage into the distant future. In most societies, this sacred act has been revered; yet, within the confines of Luyarnha, it can assume an unsettling guise. In this city, certain women find themselves beset by nightmares, only to awaken and, within mere days, experience the telltale nausea of pregnancy, despite their unblemished chastity: blessed by the offspring of a Higher Power—or so it is believed. While some regard this union as a divine blessing, it cruelly prevents the expecting mother from ever establishing a family, for the demidritch offspring rends the womb asunder with their foreign constitution during birth. Should the trauma not be swiftly attended to, the mother's life can meet an abrupt end. In response, the church has taken to gathering those who exhibit this miraculous conception to ensure their safety during labor and to exert a modicum of control over the potent half-divine progeny. For some women, particularly those of faith or those deemed unworthy of love, the prospect of receiving this so-called blessing is welcomed. Such a union would grant them sanctuary within the church's protective walls for the remainder of their lives, offering them the semblance of a family they might not have otherwise known, however fractured it may be. Yet, others are repulsed by this fate and seek to defy it, often with tragic results. Those who reject the church's embrace might give birth in forsaken alleyways, casting their children away or consigning them to orphanages. A fortunate few, perhaps bolstered by exceptional financial fortitude or familial support, succeed in bearing their offspring and providing them with as normal a childhood as Luyarnha's grim circumstances allow. This enigmatic phenomenon has left even the most erudite scholars utterly perplexed. It is widely accepted that the Great Ones are incapable of procreation, and yet. Various theories have been postulated in an attempt to fathom the origins of these peculiar offspring—some conjecture that they serve as beacons, as the Great Ones disseminate their consciousness across the vast reaches of the cosmos, with fragments ultimately embedding themselves within the bodies of these unsuspecting mothers; consequently, the resulting progeny would function as a beacon to draw the Great Ones nearer to the world—others suggest that, due to their intrinsic sterility, the Great Ones crave a surrogate through which to vicariously experience creation. However, the motives of these enigmatic entities are, by their very nature, inscrutable to the mortal mind, and any attempt to decipher their intentions is inherently constrained and flawed.

But with all of their history, they are known throughout the galaxy for being able to do one thing better than the rest: they endure. Their people have fallen and risen again in dramatic fashion to the point that we’d think they would hate all other species. But instead, it’s the opposite. Their sense of wonder and love of life is sometimes infectious. Make no mistake, though. The dendus still hold grudges... and they live for a very long time.” — Vakryth, Matokai Soldier Exotic cities layered with high technology, grand strongholds melded into the earth with neon-lit rippled spires running both above and below ground, representations of the dendus way of life, the perfect mix of tradition and evolution. Graceful Resilience Most dendus are considered short and slender compared to the other major races, with their tallest reaching just above 5 feet in height. Even then, the majority of their height stems from their long legs, which tend to hold greater length than their torsos and arms. However, even with such a slender frame, the dendus are no more or less frail than any of their neighboring races. Dendus have extremely pale skintones that range from stark white to light grays, with rare hints of red or violet. Their skin is extremely smooth and somewhat slick, similar in texture to some earth-type sea creatures. They have three appendages on each of their limbs that serve as fingers and toes. Each dendus has a collection of tentacles atop their heads which can often be misconstrued for hair at a distance. These tentacles can be guided into small movement patterns that serve as a minor form of communication between dendus and other chosen allies. They range in color from light to dark reds, purples, and grays as well as black. Ruin and Restoration Dendus live for hundreds of years, their history bearing the stark contrast of their lives today compared to their civilization centuries ago. Their homeworld, once invaded by the insectoids of Prokmel, saw most of the dendus killed and the rest forced into centuries of slavery. The discovery of one of the first Crucibles marked the liberation of Dendusar, the dendus soon translating much of the cryptic codes and markings found within the artifact, and using this newfound power to vanquish their vile masters. Their liberation was short-lived, as their world was soon set upon by the Xamaron horde, then years later again by the merciless Lorendi Imperial Fleet. Each time marked the fall of dendus civilization, resistance to their conquerors, and finally restoration of their home. Because of this, the dendus as a people are steadfast and loyal, driven by a strong sense of determination and a desire to aid those who have suffered through oppression and injustice. To fall out of favor with a dendus unit is considered a dangerous undertaking. Traditional Transformation Though the dendus are not the people they were a millennium ago, they always manage to keep certain traditions and practices intact. A prime example would be the Folas Tower on Dendusar, a high-tech spire that reaches several thousand feet from the ground up with an intricate system of cylindrical tunnels that travel miles below the surface. It has been rebuilt many times, each time with the same frame and basic design, regardless of how many lights, panels, and circuitry are layered upon its surface. A dendusian family is known as a unit, with generations of bonded units classified as “kin-lines”. Long histories are kept for each kin-line, complete with accomplishments and major events. Dendusian units are fiercely loyal to one another, even moreso than any long-standing friends or allies. This can often create conflicts whenever a unit member creates problems or situations that end up involving other relatives. Keepers of the Code After the belare, the dendus were the first to translate the markings found within the Crucibles and access many of their functions. This revolutionary discovery allowed them to make great leaps in technological advancement, such as access to an infinite energy source, faster-than-light space travel, and the creation of the ashenforged. Though other spacefaring races have learned to harness the Crucibles’ energy source, none have learned the process more efficiently than the dendus. Because of this, dendus scientific guilds can be found working on most of the active Crucibles. Those races that share the continued study of these artifacts also benefit by gaining the dendus as staunch and dedicated allies. Younger dendus grow up learning much about the Crucibles and the theories behind their existence. Thus, dendus who travel throughout the galaxy, even with their own purpose, also take interest in discovering exotic places or ancient civilizations that may have even been connected to their own at one time. Dendus Names A dendus child is named after one of the parents with the suffix “-kin” attached to the end. After they reach 10 years old, their personality and desires become more defined and they are then given a name that honors one from dendus records that has its own storied history or personality attached to it. To mark a new chapter in the child’s life, the new name is more often a variation of the historical one, rather than an exact match. A dendus’ surname is the name of their kin-line, traditionally passed down from the kin-line of the child’s mother.

Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2. Age. Dendus are considered to be young until they reach about 40 years of age. They live on average between 350 to 450 years. Alignment. The majority of dendus are lawful due to their level of dedication and loyalty. They tend to be good due to their intolerance of injustice, however they share a duality with a select few who value evolution and advancement over tradition. Size. Dendus are very slender with small torsos and elongated legs. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Accustomed to a multitude of environments, you have the ability to see different shades of light. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were in dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Fast Learner. You have proficiency in the Insight skill. Force of Will. You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws versus esper powers. Larima. Your tentacles, also known as “larima,” can be used to exhibit a burst of psychic energy similar to the mental missive talent, though the range of this ability is limited to 10 feet. Languages. You speak, read, and write Common and Dendusi. Subraces. Depending on the history of your kin-line, you fall under one of two categories of dendus.

These insane humanoids live, work, and somehow thrive in the lightless depths. They understand the truth about the uncaring gods that dwell between the stars, and they abandoned sanity long ago to save themselves. The derro hide within their insanity in the hope that the dark gods they fear will turn that sinister attention to other, saner races first. Despite the great distances between their Underworld cities and the surface, derro outposts can be found in the slums of many cities, both above and below ground. Occasionally, a derro discovers the wider world and finds a path out of the madness. Pale and Stunted The derro are stunted, dwarflike humanoids, small of stature with wide shoulders and stubby limbs. They stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, with males only slighter taller than females on average. Their slender builds rarely weigh more than 40 pounds. Their pale skin is nearly translucent, revealing a ghostly web of blue veins. Their large, pure white staring eyes gleam in the dark. Shorter than surface dwarves, derro are quick and erratic in their movements. Their elaborately braided or styled hair ranges from white to a pale straw color. Males take great pride in their prodigious mustaches, which are often braided and waxed. History of Madness The true history of the derro is an incomprehensible tangle. The entire race embraced insanity long ago. Even when they keep records, their accounts conflict with each other and with observable reality. The various cults and clans of the derro embrace a wide variety of myths, mostly passed along by oral tradition and mind-bending artwork. Every new teller of a given tale twists or rewrites portions of the story to fit their own warped view of the world. The derro have existed for ages, perhaps thriving even before the spread of humans across the surface. The more reliable histories of other races agree the derro once served the drow as enforcers and slave masters. The drow regard them with a strange type of favor, almost like dim-witted children. The aboleths and duergar have likewise historically used and abused the derro. The derro know no actual friends, but they are overawed by power and dominance. They serve beings whose assumed superiority impresses them, and, when led in this way, their insanity clears enough to keep them moving toward the leader’s goals. Culture and Rule Love, as other races know it, is unheard of in the bizarre core family unit of the derro. Derro children are born sane, but they are deliberately driven mad by their relatives, usually by age four. Parents feed, clothe, and protect their children not out of a sense of love or tenderness, but because they know that every derro awakened to the mind-bending truth of their race brings them glory. The horrific rituals that break a young derro’s sanity vary by tribe and even year to year. Details are sparse, but known ritual names include Staring into the Void, Enduring the Heartless Fire, and the First Drink of True Knowledge. Derro are paranoid, unstable, and jittery, and many suffer powerful delusions of grandeur as well. Madness compels them to commit acts of cruelty against their companions or pets, and these acts ignite constant infighting among them. A few, however, muster enough restraint and control to keep the entirety of derro society from crumbling. Savants are powerful sorcerers who hold their madness at bay long enough to cobble together coherent plans, though even they are dangerously unpredictable. The derro’s antipaladins are terrifying engines of crazed destruction who have looked deep into the void between stars and survived—and even the savants respect them for that. Clans that stick together long enough inadvertently create a witch queen among their ranks, a collective spirit of the clan. These derro become the leaders and central focuses of their clans, driving the clan to inscrutable ends. When one witch queen dies, her spirit transfers to another derro in the clan, transforming that derro into the next witch queen and perpetuating the clan. Gods of the Derro The derro worship a horde of bizarre and terrible beings. Derro ancestral gods such as Addrikah, the Mother of Madness, are common figures of veneration, as are demon lords. Perhaps the most disturbing of their deities are the Great Old Ones whose mere symbolic presence melts minds and corrupts the world. Derro worshipers venerate Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods, in particular. There is no pattern or reason that governs which dark being will catch a given derro’s fancy, and devotees are violently hostile to worshipers of other entities. Derro consider themselves the most exalted servants of the blasphemous figures they venerate; the only beings in the entire multiverse who can truly understand their deity’s glory. Specific rituals vary from cult to cult, but the unifying thread of derro faith asserts that their racial madness is a gift that makes communion with these deities possible. Further, the derro believe they are the harbingers of the end of time, and that they alone will inherit the shattered husk of creation. Derro Names Names are thrust upon derro children haphazardly and with no clear general customs. Derro who worship an ancestor god might give their children a variation on the exalted figure’s name or title, or a child might grow almost to maturity before any adult bothers to call them by the same jumble of sounds twice. Clan, tribe, and family names also lack any discernable pattern, though occasionally they form a coherent description.

Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Derro reach maturity by the age of 15 and live to be around 75. Size. Derro stand between 3 and 4 feet tall with slender limbs and wide shoulders. Your size is Small. Alignment. Their naturally unhinged minds are nearly always chaotic, and many, but not all, are evil. Speed. Derro are fast for their size. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Superior Darkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Eldritch Resilience. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws against spells. Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish and your choice of Common or Undercommon. Subrace. Three subraces of derro exist in Midgard: far-touched, mutated, and uncorrupted. Choose one of these subraces. Playing a Derro Derro are unpredictable, fanciful, and prone to delusions, confusions, and manias. So how can they function in groups more used to the stability of humans, dwarves, and elves? In truth, the derro are less violent and more peculiar in a quieter way than their common portrayal as rabid maniacs. Among themselves, they are as likely to be brooding, depressed, or sullen as crazed and violent. Your derro character could have a tendency to talk to themselves, might address an invisible friend before undertaking any major step, or might simply consider all the other members of the party as “imaginary friends” and thus not subject to harassment. Treat the derro’s madness as an occasional bit of flavor for the character, rather than an excuse to cripple the party with chaotic and self-defeating actions. A derro character won’t be as predictable as a dwarf paladin or an elfmarked bard, but the derro might occasionally talk to rocks and interrogate mushrooms. Review the Minor Madnesses table below for examples of playable and flavorful maladies that afflict your character. Choose an appropriate minor madness or roll percentile dice to randomly determine it. Your character should have at least one minor madness, but check with your GM to confirm how many and which minor madnesses are most appropriate in your campaign. To avoid derailing the party constantly, your character can have long lucid periods and might even regret actions taken when “turned to the dark void” or “ridden by the bat spirits” or a similar explanation. A derro in this lucid state could be a tragic character, always wondering when something will set off another bout of irrational raving. Keep in mind, derro are often awed by beings they see as powerful, though each derro defines what they deem as “powerful.” Your derro character could view another member of the group as the group’s “witch queen” (regardless of that character’s gender) and follow that character almost zealously. The instability of the derro could also lead your character to choose a different member of the group each day or each week as the current “witch queen.” Playing a derro character involves making a fantasy form of otherworldly madness both playable and plausible. Find a way to make your character memorable without bogging down play or spoiling everyone else’s game. Derro Subraces Derro differ based on their location within the derro communities of the Underworld, their clan’s connections to the dark powers that sculpt and manipulate the derro race, and the manifestations of the changes their otherworldly patrons bestow on them. Most derro dwell happily and deeply in their culture-induced insanity for their entire existence, others escape the madness-inducing indoctrination, and others still go straight through the madness toward powers beyond what derro usually enjoy.

Review the Minor Madnesses section on page XX for examples of playable and flavorful maladies that afflict your character. Choose an appropriate minor madness or roll percentile dice to randomly determine it. Your character should have at least one minor madness, but check with your GM to confirm how many and which minor madnesses are most appropriate in your campaign. To avoid derailing the party constantly, your character can have long lucid periods and might even regret actions taken when “turned to the dark void” or “ridden by the bat spirits” or a similar explanation. A derro in this lucid state could be a tragic character, always wondering when something will set off another bout of irrational raving. Keep in mind, derro are often awed by beings they see as powerful, though each derro defines what they deem as “powerful.” Your derro character could view another member of the group as the group’s “witch queen” (regardless of that character’s gender) and follow that character almost zealously. The instability of the derro could also lead your character to choose a different member of the group each day or each week as the current “witch queen.” Playing a derro character involves making a fantasy form of otherworldly madness both playable and plausible. Find a way to make your character memorable without bogging down play or spoiling everyone else’s game.

Their ties to the undead grant dhampirs a taste of a vampire’s deathless prowess in the form of increased speed, darkvision, and a life-draining bite. With unique insights into the nature of the undead, many dhampirs become adventurers and monster hunters. Their reasons are often deeply personal. Some seek danger, imagining monsters as personifications of their own hungers. Others pursue revenge against whatever turned them into a dhampir. And still others embrace the solitude of the hunt, striving to distance themselves from those who’d tempt their hunger. Insert: Dhampir Rogue Dhampir Hungers Every dhampir knows a thirst slaked only by the living. Those who overindulge their thirst risk losing control and forever viewing others as prey. Those who resist might find exceptional ways of controlling their urges or suppress them through constant, molar-grinding restraint. In any case, temptation haunts dhampirs, and circumstances conspire to give them endless reasons to indulge. While many dhampirs thirst for blood, your character might otherwise gain sustenance from the living. Roll on or choose an option from the Dhampir Hungers table to determine what tempts your character to feed. Dhampir Hungers d6 Hungers 1 Blood 2 Flesh or raw meat 3 Cerebral spinal fluid 4 Psychic energy 5 Dreams 6 Life energy Dhampir Origins Dhampirs often arise from encounters with vampires, but all manner of macabre bargains, necromantic influences, and encounters with mysterious immortals might have transformed your character. The Dhampir Origins table provides suggestions for how your character gained their lineage. Dhampir Origins d8 Origin 1 You are the reincarnation of an ancestor who was a vampiric tyrant. 2 Your pact with a predatory deity, fiend, fey, or spirit causes you to share their hunger. 3 You survived being attacked by a vampire but were forever changed. 4 A parasite lives inside you. You indulge its hunger. 5 Tragedy interrupted your transformation into an immortal. 6 You are a diminished form of an otherworldly being. Slaking your hunger hastens your renewal. 7 One of your parents was a vampire. 8 A radical experiment changed your body, making you reliant on others for vital fluids. Dhampirs in the Domains of Dread When creating a dhampir, ask your DM if it makes sense for your character to have ties to one of the following Domains of Dread (detailed in chapter 3): Barovia. In the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, tales flourish of those who love or descend from vampires. You might have such a connection, but dread what would happen if others in your insular community found out. Darkon. The Kargat, this shattered domain’s secret police, supposedly know the secret of immortality. Perhaps you joined and advanced through their lesser ranks, known as the Kargatane, and were rewarded by being transformed into a dhampir. I’Cath. At night, the starving city of I’Cath is overrun by vampiric jiangshi (described in chapter 5). You were left with a cold hunger after an encounter with one of these unquiet ancestors. Dhampir Traits You have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage. Speed. Your walking speed is 35 feet. Ancestral Legacy. If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it. If you don’t keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray. Deathless Nature. You don’t need to breathe. Spider Climb. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, at 3rd level, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. Vampiric Bite. Your fanged bite is a natural weapon, which counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. You add your Constitution modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with this bite. It deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit. While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with this bite. When you attack with this bite and hit a creature that isn’t a Construct or an Undead, you can empower yourself in one of the following ways of your choice: You regain hit points equal to the piercing damage dealt by the bite. You gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make; the bonus equals the piercing damage dealt by the bite You can empower yourself with this bite a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Stigma and suspicion follow them regardless of whether the truth of a dhampir child’s nature is known. This mistrust either forces a dhampir to develop a disarming wit and charm, or to embrace bitterness and keep others at arm’s length through guile or outright intimidation. Few dhampirs find solace with their undead forebears. As living creatures, even tainted ones, the reality of living with an evil, blood-sucking monster seldom appeals even as they struggle with their own urges or hungers. Dhampirs struggle to find acceptance both within society and within themselves. The dhampir of the Underworld, on the other hand, are slightly more feral than their surface kin due to a harsh upbringing of fending for themselves against the innumerable dangers in the realms below. There is sometimes a home for them in the Underworld, as part of the Ghoul Imperium, if they are willing to pledge loyalty to the Emperor. That is not to say the darakhul completely trust the dhampir who come to them seeking a place in the world. But the ghouls know how to use the tools at their disposal, and they are happy to open their arms to allies who carry a tinge of undeath. Lithe and Graceful Dhampirs appear much like humans at first glance. Adults stand between 5 and 6 feet tall but are more slender on average than humans; males weigh around 160 pounds. Female dhampirs are only slightly shorter but are a fair bit leaner, weighing around 120 pounds. Their skin and hair color runs the vast spectrum of tones available to humans, though they tend to be slightly pale. The flawless features of the surface-dwelling dhampir are tinged with some unnamable exotic quality. Despite the fear and uncertainty that follow them, these half-dead possess a seductive appearance. Listeners find themselves unconsciously giving weight to a dhampir’s words and are drawn to the exotic presence. Dhampirs glide through life with a seemingly effortless grace that belies their struggle. The Underworld dhampir have no need to keep up appearances, however. They are just as likely to let their hair grow wild and their clothes get tattered as they are to try to appear or act in a seductive manner. Their movements and actions still have a graceful quality, to be sure, but it is the grace of a predator on the prowl. Blood Ties For most dhampirs, family is all they have. Immediate kin might be the only source of solace for a dhampir raised by a mortal family. Driven away by the unconscious or superstitious derision of their peers, families containing a dhampir can easily become clannish and reclusive. They learn to keep the world at a distance to protect themselves and their loved ones. Dhampirs who grow up in this situation commonly strike out on their own after reaching maturity, both out of a need to find connection to the greater world and to spare their family the burden of their presence. Conversely, some dhampirs are born into bloodlines that deliberately cultivate their tainted nature. A true vampire patron, usually the one who originally began the line, oversees these bloodlines. Such a bloodline holds its lineage in the highest regard. There is no doubt among its members that theirs is a superior stock and upbringing, and that greatness is their due. The majority of outright evil dhampirs arise from cultivated bloodlines. They quickly become true monsters, seeing a living creature’s fear as envy of their station. Underworld dhampir, sometimes called feral dhampir, are most often loners who understand that the world of light and life is not for them. In the subterranean dark, there is still plenty of blood to sate their thirst, and much darker creatures than dhampir haunt the depths of the world. Cultural Masks Particularly close-knit or cosmopolitan communities can easily tolerate a dhampir in their midst, but that has more to do with adherence to tradition or relative anonymity than true acceptance. Larger cities include dhampirs sprinkled among the population as the half-dead blend in and find their niche, relying on their innate charm. Dhampir don’t relate easily to humans but find a natural kinship with other half-breed races, particularly the fiendish tieflings. They, along with elfmarked, know all too well what it’s like to live between two worlds, never truly fitting in to either. Some dhampirs choose to band together for safety, camaraderie, and understanding. These groups are nomadic, traveling from town to town and making their living off the land. Such a band adheres to a loose set of guidelines called the Walking Crow edicts. These rules dictate the dhampirs’ responsibility to protect one another from outsiders, for each caravan group to self-govern and be self-sustaining, and for every Crow to work toward the prosperity of the caravan. These groups rarely find warm welcome with outsiders, but they are often tolerated for their diverse adventuring skills. Despite their trepidation, villagers can resolve threats to their homes by hiring a band of Crows to handle the problem for them. Candles in the Dark Dhampirs constantly struggle with their nature. They suffer from a troubled upbringing and intrinsic corruption that gnaws at civilized thoughts and behavior. The truth of their heritage weighs on them. Many experience disturbing urges to consume blood or to control others. They shun the light and find safety and comfort in darkness. Enticed and repulsed by mortals at the same time, constant struggle is at the core of a dhampir’s existence. Many dhampirs use this struggle as fuel to action. Good dhampirs are horrified by their own corrupted existence and dedicate themselves to living in opposition to it. They become priests who venerate gods of light, or they vow to destroy all undead who perpetuate their misery. Others are broken by their turmoil. They lash out at the world in a rage of bloodlust and hatred. Many evil dhampirs turn to worship of demons and other gods of darkness and pain, seeking to conquer and subjugate their mortal peers. Dhampir Names Most dhampirs bear names appropriate to their mothers’ human culture. Some, particularly those belonging to cultivated bloodlines, might have archaic names chosen by, or in honor of, their family’s vampire patron. Surnames follow a similar pattern. Dhampirs might use the family name of their mortal relatives, or they might adopt the family name of a powerful vampire as a badge of office. Nomadic dhampirs uniformly take the surname “Crow.” Dhampir Traits Your dhampir character has certain characteristics derived from your undead ancestry. Age. Dhampirs reach maturity at the same age as humans, but their lifespans are much longer. They can live up to 750 years before death finally claims them. Alignment. Most dhampirs are neutral, but some are driven toward evil by the bitterness and suspicion their parentage thrusts upon them. A few turn toward good in defiance of their nature. Size.

You can bite as an unarmed strike against an incapacitated creature or one you have grappled. Your bite deals 1 point of piercing damage, and if the creature has blood and isn’t a construct or undead, you can feed from it as part of the attack.

A hostile creature won’t necessarily attack outright, but it won’t deal with you in any way and might actively try to hinder you. You can use this trait once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. A creature immune to being charmed is immune to your predatory charm. Undead Resistance.

The city-state of Draconia rose in the Dreemoth Ravine along the southern edge of the continent, when foreign dragonkin fleeing the gods’ wrath during the Calamity forged an alliance with native dragonborn already dwelling there. The colonizing dragonborn, who called themselves draconbloods, worked with the native dragonborn, called ravenites, to build a society that could withstand the wandering monsters of Xhorhas. However, Draconia swiftly descended into corruption and bigotry, and the draconblood ruling class betrayed and enslaved their ravenite kin. Twenty years ago, Draconia was destroyed by the ire of the mighty Chroma Conclave, and the city-state’s ruins were occupied by an ancient white dragon named Vorugal. The chaos of the attack upended draconblood civilization, and the ravenite slaves rose up and drove their former masters from the Dreemoth Ravine. Now masters of their own fate, the ravenite dragonborn have rebuilt their home within the ravine and have begun to spread out across the world. Dragonborn Variants You can allow a player to choose one of the following dragonborn variants. Dragonborn Variant: Draconblood Draconbloods possess long tails and a knack for social manipulation. They remember the days when they were once mighty conquerors. A draconblood uses the dragonborn traits in the Player’s Handbook , with the following traits replacing the Ability Score Increase and Damage Resistance traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Forceful Presence. You can use your understanding of creative diplomacy or intimidation to guide a conversation in your favor. When you make a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, you can do so with advantage. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Dragonborn in the Dwendalian Empire The Dwendalian Empire has seen a massive influx of dragonborn since the fall of Draconia. Most of the draconblood nobles who fled into the empire tried to use their grandiloquent names and titles to earn favors and prestige. But without the power of a nation-state behind them, many of those former slave owners were forced into lives of farming or hard labor. Some in the empire speak in awed whispers of the “former dragonborn princes” who now live as paupers, while others scoff at these haughty dragonborn’s delusions of grandeur. Many ravenites have journeyed to the Dwendalian Empire in the years since the death of Vorugal, but the first of those found a colder reception than was given their former masters. The empire had no desire to grant asylum to revolutionaries, and would have turned the ravenites away had the Cerberus Assembly not intervened. For reasons unknown, the Assembly created the shantytown of Talonstadt for displaced ravenites, allowing them to trade labor for lodging there. Dragonborn on the Menagerie Coast Many of the draconbloods fleeing their ruined city-state settled among the people of the Clovis Concord. Some had beach homes and private villas to flee to, and were able to establish businesses with the money they had stashed away there. Others were not so fortunate, and were forced to take menial jobs to make ends meet. Many residents of the Clovis Concord feel a twinge of sympathy for the draconblood exiles, but most commoners who have any knowledge of the ravenite uprising see this life of servitude as just punishment. Many of the ravenites who travel to the warm sands of the coast are merchants or wealthy generals or politicians on vacation. As such, all ravenites on the Menagerie Coast are assumed to have wealth—even exiles or penniless adventurers. Any tailless dragonborn who wanders through the cities of the Clovis Concord must constantly fend off hucksters, peddlers, and thieves. Dragonborn in Xhorhas Countless draconbloods fled into the wastes of Xhorhas in search of asylum, and some even dared approach the intimidating walls of Rosohna. The dark elves of the Kryn Dynasty were eager to welcome these formerly isolated people into their ranks—though their reasons for doing so were less than altruistic. More dragonborn living within range of the Luxon’s beacons deepens the well of experiences that drow engaged in anamnesis can draw from, bringing their people closer to true enlightenment. The dark elves have no interest in the rift between the draconbloods and the ravenites, and treat both peoples as equals.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Explorer's Guide to Wildemount (deprecated)"},{"name":"Draconblood Dragonborn","description":"Draconbloods possess long tails and a knack for social manipulation.

The scales of his face had grown paler around the edges, but Clanless Mehen still looked as if he could wrestle down a dire bear himself. His familiar well-worn armor was gone, replaced by violet-tinted scale armor with bright silvery tracings. There was a blazon on his arm as well, the mark of some foreign house. The sword at his back was the same, though, the one he had carried since even before he had found the twins left in swaddling at the gates of Arush Vayem. For all her life, Farideh had known that reading her father’s face was a skill she’d been fortunate to learn. A human who couldn’t spot the shift of her eyes or Havilar’s would certainly see only the indifference of a dragon in Clanless Mehen’s face. But the shift of scales, the arch of a ridge, the set of his eyes, the gape of his teeth—her father’s face spoke volumes. But every scale of it, this time, seemed completely still—the indifference of a dragon, even to Farideh. —Erin M. Evans, The Adversary Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic⁠ gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life. Proud Dragon Kin Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand. The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze. Self-Sufficient Clans To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position. A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn. Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races—or even from the gods. Dragonborn Names Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor. A childhood⁠ name or nickname is often used among clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of endearment. The name might recall an event or center on a habit.

Draconians In the Dragonlance setting, the followers of the evil goddess Takhisis learned a dark ritual that let them corrupt the eggs of metallic dragons, producing evil dragonborn called draconians. Five types of draconians, corresponding to the five types of metallic dragons, fought for Takhisis in the War of the Lance: auraks (gold), baaz (brass), bozak (bronze), kapak (copper), and sivak (silver).

Beauty. Art. According to the Dreevith, toad-like humanoids living in the swamps of Shamrua, these are the keys to the soul. And those who have true access to their soul gain freedom, happiness and enlightenment. All three of these aspects are included in the word Gron'Dab, the great goal of every single soul. Dreevith resemble slender walking toads, with wide mouths and large vocal sacs. They usually have a combination of green and yellow skin colours, but many other variations are known. Occasionally, completely white Dreevith are born, which are seen as \"children of wonder\" in their society. Despite their philosophical and mostly peaceful outlook on life, the Dreevith can be fierce warriors. In their understanding, every soul has a right to nourish and to defend itself, and those who cannot do it themselves. So while they are philosophers at heart, they are savants with swords (or clubs, or magic). The scourge of the hags in the Shamruan swamps has been a thorn in their side since a long time, and many Dreevith hunt the evil crones. Others travel the world seeking knowledge, deeper understanding or simply more life experience. When the apocalypse hit, the toad-like humanoids weren't fully surprised. Many of them had been fighting against the events leading to the end of the world since years. Others had foreseen great dangers simply by observing current events. They might not have known exactly what was coming, but they knew it was big and bad. As the world was torn apart, many Dreevith were ready. They knew their souls would move on to the afterlife, and they would continue their journey for Gron'Dab there. Of course, this doesn't mean they weren't frightened - but overall, this race probably handled the whole situation better than most. When their homelands were saved, and Ashandri was created, most of them were stunned - and in awe. They had experienced a miracle, and many of them decided this new world had to be explored and newly understood. Others believed their philosophies could be a cure to the suffering these events brought upon the other survivors of the apocalypse. So, upon the wake of the new world, many Dreevith spread out into the other regions, leaving their home of Shamrua. Culture Dreevith deeply believe that every soul has its own path. This belief is the foundation for a highly individualistic culture, in which society is merely the gardener that helps an individual grow to its fullest potential. While most of them live in tribes and small villages, there are tales of hidden Dreevith cities. As even other members of this race haven't found these great settlements, though, it is unlikely that the tales are true. While in their home lands, most Dreevith are only scantily clad. To them, clothes are more like decoration than protection. If they actually need protection, whether against a different climate or in battle, they are fully capable of wearing regular clothes or armour. They just don't like it very much. The toad-like humanoids often wear feather headdresses, belts, and tribal amulets. If they feel they won't be accepted that way in a different society, they usually adapt to the local habits. To them, it's an experience that helps understand others. But it's still a free decision, and if they don't feel like it - well, then they don't do it. Despite their small villages and clan-like social structures, the Dreevith have a surprisingly advanced culture. Every settlement has at least one Keeper, an individual who writes down historic events and important insights. Dreevith scrolls are made from swamp grass in a highly complicated process, and they withstand practically everything - except for magical damage. Still, the scrolls themselves are not magical, and their creation is a secret the Keepers don't even share with other members of their tribe. Names Dreevith names reflect how an individual sees itself. Nobody has the right to give anyone a name, so members of this species choose their own name as soon as they are ready for it - usually at about four to six years. The names are usually nouns with meanings like \"storm\", \"vastness\" or \"sleeper\", but in the end, it's up to the Dreevith what name they chose. If they change their personality or begin a new chapter in their life, they often change their names, too. The old name becomes part of their story, and can be added to the current name with an \"arobo\" put before: Varbarth arobo Gumba Vada, for example, would be someone whose very first name was Vada, then he changed it to Gumba, and now he is called Varbarth. The word “Arobo” could be translated as “personal story”, but is only used in the context of names. Dreevith words are mostly relatively simple. The vocals a, o and u are dominant in their language, and they prefer softer consonants. Common names for all genders, along with their meanings, are: Mullub: Hunter Shovor: Seeker Gananda: Explorer Gobba: Inner turmoil Ulubong: Honesty Mogg: Traveller Anatomy Dreevith hatch from eggs. In the first two or three months, they live as tadpoles in small ponds, until they become toadlets. At first, they are no larger than a human's fingertip, but grow rapidly. In this time, they live under protection of their tribe, slowly exploring the close vicinity of their birthplace. It takes almost another three years until they are fully grown. Within the third year, they slowly learn to walk upright, and develop their full mental capabilities. Dreevith skin is often green and yellow, but a minority has other colours, too. A few have bright and shining colours, and very rarely, a completely white Dreevith is born. Glands keep their skin slightly wet all the time. Some Dreevith have the typical warts known from other toad species, but most of them don't. Their mouths are so wide that it almost reaches from one side of their face to the other. Below that lies the vocal sac, which is always visible as a small bump. Opposite to most toads, these vocal sacs are not exclusive to the males of the species. Both genders use this throat pouch to attract those they find sexually or romantically appealing. In rare cases, this is not limited to their own race, leading to the occasional confusing situations - especially if the mating call comes out involuntarily (which isn't common, but it happens). Being very aware of other people's boundaries, they usually apologize heavily for it, and understand they need to increase their own self-awareness. Dreevith prefer a diet of insects and arachnoids, but they are capable of eating other meat, too. For a short time, they can live on a vegetary diet, but their physiology isn't really laid out for it. If they don't get their regular diet after three days, they begin to starve, leading to death after about five to ten days. Traits Ability Score Increase: Wisdom+2, Dexterity+1 Age: Dreevith hatch from eggs, and mature after three years. They can get as old as 50. Alignment: Almost all Dreevith are good-aligned. But even here, the decisions are individual, and a few cases of neutral or even evil Dreevith are known. Size: The toad-like humanoids grow between five and eight feet, giving them medium size. Languages: Dreevith have their own language. You can also speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a Swimming speed of 30 feet. Strong legs: You add 10 feet to how far or high you can jump. Poison Tongue: You can attack an enemy with your tongue with a reach of 10 feet. The attack only makes one point of bludgeoning damage, but if it hits bare skin, you transmit a contact poison. The target has to succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw against DC 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. On a failure, they get the Poisoned condition until the end of their next turn. Once used, you can't use the Poison tongue again until you’ve had a long rest. You can still use the attack without poison. Good Listener: If you had the chance to have a personal talk with someone, and really get to know them a little, you get advantage on Insight checks targeted at that person. Self-aware: The Dreevith think so much about who they are, and explore their own personalities, that it’s hard to influence their minds and emotions. You get advantage on saving throws against any kind of charming or other mind-affecting spells. At 5th level, you become immune to being charmed.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Drow","description":"The denizens of the surface world did not know of the existence of the drow until recently in the world’s history. Even other creatures who lived beneath the surface only heard of the race through rumors and half-mythical stories. The magnificent cities and structures created by the drow were viewed by very few outsiders, as the locales were kept secret, protected by traps, magic, and a network of fortifications and soldiers. With the rise of the darakhul and their empires, however, the drow civilization is now exposed to the rest of the world and on the brink of annihilation. A Hidden Race The beginnings of the drow race are shrouded in mystery. With their resemblance to the elves of the surface world, many would posit the drow are some subterranean offshoot of that surface race, driven underground for some treacherous and evil acts. The truth is practically the opposite. The drow lived long before the surface elves, and if there is any connection between the two races at all, the drow are the elders. The skin of a drow ranges from grey to blue-black to the darkest ebon. Their features are delicate and streamlined, and their eyes glow red. Drow who have hair generally sport white or silver hair, and they do not grow facial or body hair. The Religion of Industry The drow pattern their entire way of life by the strength and beauty of the work of underground insects. These insects, though seemingly small and insignificant, create great structures, while at the same time having the power to destroy even the greatest enemy. Drow structures are built with materials as fine and as strong as spider webs. Their fortifications are like the colonies of ants: defensible and carefully planned. The various beetles that are now common sights in darakhul cities were first utilized and bred by the drow centuries ago, though the darakhul have, in their minds, perfected these creatures in recent years. The religious ceremonies of the drow also follow patterns of insectoid energy and cooperation. Everyone has a place, from the weakest to the most powerful. If one fails to do their job well, all will suffer the consequences. Careful planning and execution can overcome any obstacle. Unfortunately, the defeats suffered at the hands of darakhul have left many drow questioning their faith. Some want to begin worshipping new, more violent forces to turn the tides. Even those who still cling to the old ways are split on whether to go into hiding or commit to a full-blown assault on the darakhul. Terrible Defeats At first, the territories controlled by the darakhul did not intersect with that of the drow. As the darakhul spread further and further throughout the caverns beneath the surface, skirmishes between the outer guard and advance scouts of the drow and darakhul became more frequent. Realizing that such a powerful force and rich food supply was within reach, the darakhul quickly took the fight to the drow in their own cities. The drow had never before been successfully invaded, but they had never before been attacked by a force like the darakhul. The drow relied on traps and defenses that employed poison or necrotic magic, which was great against living foes but mostly ineffective against the darakhul. Unable to kill what was already dead, the drow watched one city after another fall. And to make matters worse, their own dead were rising up as the enemy and joining the darakhul ranks. Drow Names Drow are named by their families at birth, with the names having meanings that convey the wishes of the family for the child. Common drow names translate as obedient, ingenious, commanding, and fearless. Female Names: Ar’tik, Berril, Chi’zzl, Dillin, Fal’zzn, Id’sin, Li’liin, Mzz’ik, Ni’zzt, Ril’sir, Til’zzr Male Names: Ber’zzn, Chr’fru, Dro’shu, Fru’kkr, Har’trk, Joor’tzz, Kru’jat, Ohb’qor, Pzz’lok, Vor’tre Drow Traits Your drow character has certain characteristics in common with all other drow. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Age. Drow physically mature at the same rate as humans, but they aren’t considered adults until they reach the age of 50. They typically live to be around 500. Size. Drow are slightly shorter and slimmer than humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Alignment. Drow believe in reason and rationality, which leads them to favor lawful activities. However, their current dire situation makes them more prone than their ancestors to chaotic behavior. Their vicious fight for survival makes them capable of doing great evil in the name of self-preservation, although they are not, by nature, prone to evil in other circumstances. Superior Darkvision. Accustomed to life in the darkest depths of the world, you can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Mind of Steel. You understand the complexities of minds, as well as the magic that can affect them. You have advantage on Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws against spells. Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Elvish and your choice of Common or Undercommon. Subrace. Three subraces of drow exist: delver, purified, and the more recent fever-bit. Choose one of these subraces. Drow Subraces The drow are generally born into different castes, which determines what is expected of them in drow society. The delvers are the workers who maintain the (once) magnificent drow cities, serve in the drow military, and keep the rest of the drow safe and fed. The purified make up the leaders, skilled laborers, and magic-users of the drow.

Unfortunately, the defeats suffered at the hands of darakhul have left many drow questioning their faith. Some want to begin worshipping new, more violent forces to turn the tides. Even those who still cling to the old ways are split on whether to go into hiding or commit to a full-blown assault on the ghouls. Terrible Defeats At first, the territory controlled by the darakhul did not intersect with that of the drow. As the Ghoul Imperium spread further and further throughout the Underworld, skirmishes between the outer guard and advance scouts of the drow and darakhul became more frequent. Realizing that such a powerful force and rich food supply was within reach, the darakhul quickly took the fight to the drow in their own cities. The drow had never before been successfully invaded, but they had never before been attacked by a force like the darakhul. The drow relied on traps and defenses that employed poison or necrotic magic, which was great against living foes but mostly ineffective against the darakhul. Unable to kill what was already dead, the drow watched one city after another fall. And to make matters worse, their own dead were rising up as the enemy and joining the darakhul ranks. Drow Names Drow are named by their families at birth, with the names having meanings that convey the wishes of the family for the child. Common drow names translate as obedient, ingenious, commanding, and fearless. Female Names: Ar’tik, Berril, Chi’zzl, Dillin, Fal’zzn, Id’sin, Li’liin, Mzz’ik, Ni’zzt, Ril’sir, Til’zzr Male Names: Ber’zzn, Chr’fru, Dro’shu, Fru’kkr, Har’trk, Joor’tzz, Kru’jat, Ohb’qor, Pzz’lok, Vor’tre Drow Traits Your drow character has certain characteristics in common with all other drow. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Age. Drow physically mature at the same rate as humans, but they aren’t considered adults until they reach the age of 50. They typically live to be around 500. Size. Drow are slightly shorter and slimmer than humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Alignment. Drow believe in reason and rationality, which leads them to favor lawful activities. However, their current dire situation makes them more prone than their ancestors to chaotic behavior. Their vicious fight for survival makes them capable of doing great evil in the name of self-preservation, although they are not by nature prone to evil in other circumstances. Superior Darkvision. Accustomed to life in the darkest depths of the world, you can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Mind of Steel. You understand the complexities of minds, as well as the magic that can affect them. You have advantage on Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws against spells. Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Elvish and your choice of Common or Undercommon. Subrace. Three subraces of drow exist in Midgard: delver, purified, and the more recent fever-bit. Choose one of these subraces. Playing a Drow You were born into a civilization that survived and thrived on order, stability, rational thought, and careful planning. Within your lifetime, you watched all of that come crashing down. The darakhul forces have you on the run, hiding out in small pockets of civilization, moving from place to place to avoid detection, or hearing about the devastation from a safe place far from the battle lines. Some within your ranks want to completely change the way drow live, create new rules and new ways of life, and do everything and anything to survive. Others believe this is naught but a new test of your people’s resolve, and that only by remaining faithful to the old ways can you defeat your enemy. Wherever you come down on this debate, you have a new, strange world in front of you. Drow Subraces The drow are generally born into different castes, which determines what is expected of them in drow society. The delvers are the workers who maintain the (once) magnificent drow cities, serve in the drow military, and keep the rest of the drow safe and fed. The purified make up the leaders, skilled laborers, and magic-users of the drow. With the war between the drow and the darakhul going so poorly, a new and growing population of drow, called the fever-bit, have been infected with darakhul fever and survived, changing them into something quite new—and potentially powerful.

Fueled by Underdark magic, those experiments left early duergar with psionic powers, which have been passed down to their descendants.

Their ability to survive in almost any environment and the prolific rate at which they breed enables them to face nearly any challenge that comes their way. Indeed, in a land populated by otherworldly horrors, unhinged cultists, and rampaging dragons, that they not only survive but prosper is something of a miracle. MALNOURISHED AND TWISTED Dust goblins appear to be perpetually underfed because of their thin limbs and swollen bellies. Their skin is dry and cracked from exposure to sun and wind, and their hands and feet are heavily callused. Dust goblins are roughly the same size as others of their ilk, with dusky gray to dark green skin and dark red, black, or green hair. Their eyes are invariably yellow or red and seem close to bulging out of their sockets. Some dust goblins are born with deformities such as an extra (but useless) limb or ugly boils covering their bodies, but these defects have no impact on their abilities. FEARLESS TINKERERS Dust goblins are driven by two universal characteristics: a lack of fear, even in the face of overwhelming odds, and an insatiable interest in anything ancient and magical, particularly if such a thing can be made to blow up or otherwise harm another individual. Why dust goblins are so different from their cowardly cousins has long been a cause of conjecture among sages and scholars. Some believe their minds have been warped by prolonged exposure to aberrations or foul magic, others that the race has been blessed by a mad god, and a few maintain that they were specifically bred long ago to enhance their fearlessness and curiosity. Although dust goblins are not the equal of gnomes or dwarves when it comes to craftsmanship, they have a knack for activating and using technological devices that others might find perplexing or distasteful. For instance, they have no qualms about making use of any vril technology or chaos devices they might find in an abandoned ruin or in a lich’s tower. DUST GOBLIN TRAITS Your dust goblin character has the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity increases by 2, and your Constitution increases by 1. Age. Dust goblins are a short-lived race, reaching adulthood at age 10 and living approximately 40 years. Alignment. Dust goblins lean toward neutrality and evil, though an individual’s alignment is heavily dependent on where it lives. Dust goblins who have grown up in more stable environments are often lawful in alignment despite their somewhat twisted perspectives. Size. Dust goblins range between 2 and 4 feet in height and weigh between 20 and 80 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed. Dust goblins are exceptionally fast for creatures of small stature. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Chaotic Mindset. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. Sneaky and Wily. You have proficiency in the Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Survival) skills. Heinous. When you attack a creature that is unaware of your presence, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failure, the target is frightened of you until the end of its next turn. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":25357},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Wastes of Chaos"},{"name":"Dwarf","description":"These D&D 5E Free Basic Rules only contain a fraction of the races, subclasses, backgrounds, feats, items, monsters, spells, and other content available on Roll20.

Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort, the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d find ye in trouble if I came out an’ looked for ye! ” —R. A. Salvatore, The Cr⁠ystal Shard⁠ Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred⁠ of goblins and orcs—these common⁠ threads unite all dwarves. Short and Stout Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled⁠ warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves⁠ are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk. Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common⁠ shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves⁠ value their beards highly and groom them carefully. Long Memory, Long Grudges Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves⁠ living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack. Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves⁠, who uphold the dwarven ideals⁠ of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge. Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves⁠ have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud. Clans and Kingdoms Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves⁠ this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth⁠ they can’t find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them. The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves⁠ who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves⁠, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf. Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.

A dwarf might seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might sea⁠rch for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago. Slow⁠ to Trust Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. “The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust. Elves. “It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer⁠ meets the orc’s head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.” Halflings. “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure⁠ for the ages made by halfling⁠ hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?” Humans. “You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, she’s got kin—a daughter or granddaughter, maybe—who’s got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.” Dwarf Names A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.

Dwarven society is structured along familial lines, and as with the Dorns, clan loyalty and honor lie at the center of their lives. Historical records indicate that in the First Age, more than six hundred dwarven clanholds were spread throughout the Kaladrun Mountains. Now there are fewer than two hundred, and this number continues to fall as the Shadow advances. The clan is the basic dwarven social and political unit. The smallest clans may contain as few as one hundred individuals and the largest many thousands. Alliances between the clans are fluid, complicated affairs, most typically formed by intermarriage or common enemies. In bygone days, skirmishes between the various clans were common, but in the past centuries of war, such hot-bloodedness has instead been exercised against the forces of Izrador. For matters of governance that affect all dwarves, great clanmoots were once called where representatives of each clan would meet in raucous assemblies to determine collective courses of action. The cantankerous and aggressive nature of these meetings is a reflection of dwarven clan relations at large. In addition to the clan structure of dwarven society, there is another important social distinction within typical dwarven culture. Most dwarves, about four out of every five clans, live underground in warren-like holdfasts carved out of the hard flesh of the mountains. The remaining clans are called the Kurgun, the \"surface dwellers.\" The Kurgun still live in the old dwarven surface cities of the southern Kaladruns that predate the First Age and the digging out of the holdfasts. Though dwarves were once known as the smiths of Eredane, their work has become a rarity in the surface world. They have grown increasingly isolationist since the end of the Second Age, trading only with the gnomes and only for necessities. Since the fall of Erenland, the clanholds have severed almost all contact with the world beyond their mountains, and all their craft has now been turned to their people’s continuing survival. The dwarves are master weaponsmiths and armorers and rival the elves in the art of enchanting armaments. Any weapon long used by a dwarf soon earns a name, and its history can become a legacy passed down in the history of the clan. Weapons that have proven themselves are often subsequently enchanted by the loremasters of the dwarven clans, and more spells are laid upon the weapon as its glory waxes. Every clan has an armory of hereditary weapons that feature prominently in their legends and their war cries. One of the greatest honors a clan can bestow on one of its kin is to deign them worthy of carrying one of these weapons into battle. Dwarf Traits If you want to play a dwarf in Midnight , you may choose to use the following traits instead of the dwarf traits found in the SRD. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age. Dwarves mature at a rate similar to that of humans, but they traditionally weren’t given the rights of full members of the clan and treated as adults until they reached the age of fifty. With the terrible attrition from ongoing war against the Shadow, however, most dwarves are treated as full adults once they reach their twenties. A lucky dwarf may live for four centuries. Size. Dwarves are usually around 4 feet, 6 inches tall and tend to weigh roughly 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor. Feat. You gain one heroic path feat of your choice. Darkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

You gain proficiency with one type of artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools. Languages.

Squat and often bearded, the original dwarves carved cities and strongholds into mountainsides and under the earth. Their oldest legends tell of conflicts with the monsters of mountaintops and the Underdark, whether those monsters were towering giants or subterranean horrors. Inspired by those tales, dwarves of any culture often sing of valorous deeds—especially of the little overcoming the mighty. On some worlds in the multiverse, the first settlements of dwarves were built in hills or mountains, and the families who trace their ancestry to those settlements call themselves hill dwarves or mountain dwarves, respectively. The Greyhawk and Dragonlance settings have such communities. Dwarf Traits As a Dwarf, you have these special traits. Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet. Dwarven Resilience.

Back in those days, dwarves were towering, magical beings called gigantes, serving their ancestors, the titans, by bringing order to the chaotic flux of magic. This was mostly done by mining the Earth for stone and ore, which was then used to build palaces for the titans to live in, and armor and weapons to make them invincible. Then two catastrophes happened. The first one is well remembered in the legends of the nani: The titans grew ever greedier for both Possibility and Permanence, until one day they rebelled against God and his plan. The gigantes were forced to choose sides in this conflict, and wisely they chose to stand with God. The titans were imprisoned in the Earth, and the gigantes became their keepers. About the second catastrophe there is much speculation amongst today’s nani. Something terrible must have happened, something which greatly diminished both the physical height and the inherent magic in the gigantes. What it was, most nani are still unsure about. Due to their strong sense of duty, they still guard the prisons of the titans. Their fear of what might happen if their ancestors should ever awaken and force themselves on the Earth again might also play a role. Dwarves live in hidden cities, away from the prying eyes of humans. Of these realms, the most important ones are those that actually guard a titan. Even though dwarves often have kings, queens and a nobility, their societies tend to be much more egalitarian and communal than those of humanity. This might be due to their relatively small number in our times, and so every single dwarf is cherished and much needed. The dwarves remember a time when they were much closer to humanity, and there is some resentment in many nani that this isn’t the case anymore. Back in the days, dwarves helped build the cities of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, enjoyed and contributed to the arts and culture of classical Greece, and served in the Roman army. But then, slowly, humanity became self-centered and the rise of the Catholic Church didn’t do much good for the relations of humans and dwarves either. This is quite unfortunate, really, as the teachings of Christ make a lot of sense to many of the nani, but there was less and less space for them in the Church once it became so fixed on dogma. Dwarves – Nani Traits Appearance. Please note that the dwarves in our setting do not necessarily look like the typical fantasy being. Not all of them have huge noses or long beards, and females particularly can be quite beautiful. They will however be of rather stocky and muscular stature. Ability Score Increase.

They might have even achieved the mercurial state of the belare at the height of their potential. Maybe what happened to them, the fracturing of their species, was inevitable. Like the belare, they could have been so powerful that the universe needed to give them a lesson in humility. If that was the case, the eldori have certainly learned that lesson better than the rest of us. ” — Gento Mosh, kesh explorer One of the oldest of the major races, the eldori are a people whose wisdom and stability are a product of many years of experience and growth. Self-proclaimed guardians of life in the universe, they are often viewed as pompous but well respected nonetheless. Dawn of the Second Age Of all the races of the Sorium Accord, there have been few more affected by the mystery of the Crucibles than the nesieve. The eldori are one part of the Nesieve race, divided after their first encounter with one of the mysterious Crucibles. Nearly a millennium ago, their native planet, Eldor, was blessed with two moons that graced their night skies for as long as their own legends carry. Once they were able to successfully travel beyond their atmosphere, they discovered that one of these glowing moons was, in fact, a dormant Crucible. When the fledgling spacefarers activated the artifact, an energy surge was unleashed, engulfing Eldor and its sister moon. This event forever changed the destiny of all nesieve. The Awakened Planet The transformation of Eldor was so abrupt and drastic as to be cataclysmic. The landscape erupted into pockets of elemental chaos. Much of the native flora and fauna died out, while some evolved or were replaced by new ones. Even more confusing were the nesieve themselves, exhibiting dangerous and uncontrollable abilities far beyond their comprehension. At first, it seemed as if the pandemonium would spell doom for Eldor. Then, mysteriously, much of the chaos subsided. The nesieve began to adapt and control their newfound abilities, in addition to becoming more attuned to the nature of their world. This metaphysical connection to the ebb and flow of creation became the greatest of gifts from what was originally viewed as the end of their world. With this newfound understanding of their attunement, there also came a renewed hope. Newly evolved as a people, they later came to call themselves “Eldori,” in honor of their reborn homeworld. The Great Wheel The eldori today carry a very spiritual point of view. They believe the creative and destructive power of the Crucibles lie in another state of existence, spinning in an eternal balance they call “The Great Wheel.” Attunement to sorium allows the eldori to speak the language of the Wheel and call upon its power. This bonding method became the foundation for the way sorium is forged and used today. Forces of Nature Eldori look much different today than they did before their awakening. They are humanoid, sharing similar traits with other bipedals. Their skin is mostly smooth with very slight ridges only noticeable by touch, having a texture similar to a soft plant. They range in color from bluish gray to deep blues to blue-green hues. Their hair is commonly silky in texture with colors tending toward bright white, silver, and gray. Their eye color varies from blues and greens to browns, with amber and red not uncommon. Though they are all minor espers to some extent, there are rare cases when an eldori attains full Esper Genesis (in game terms, a character who is 1st level or higher in any character class). This is usually accompanied by the eldori’s hair turning black. The eldori believe this change represents the esper’s ability to walk the shadow between their world and the realm of the Great Wheel. Eldori Names Upon birth, eldori children emanate a faint glow, signifying their connection to an aspect of life and nature. Each child is given a name that symbolizes that aspect of nature. Whether this “glow” is truly evidence of such a connection or merely a byproduct of genetics has been a subject of scientific discussion for centuries. However, it has not stopped the eldori from continuing the practice. Eldori usually take on the surname of their family, though there are some that adopt the name of a famous ancestor. Male Names: Anvar, Aragir, Di’meros, Erdian, Glanan, Helvas, Imridair, Ivas, Poemo, Queleri, Ravin, Roloe, Stavias, Varlis, Yamaris Female Names: Adrea, Analee, Berylia, Cadania, Enri, Ifele, Je’mira, Ki’lenna, Lia, Naivara, Ryla, Valyka, Variel, Xavare, Ze’miri Surnames: Arvacia, Cerno, Danleth, Galaniel, Holridin, Ilfena, Lysenkir, Myralion, Pravian, Safi Eldori Traits The eldori share a few common traits as a result of their spiritual awakening.

Eldori have slim builds with heights that vary between 5 to 6 feet on average. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Your inherent nature grants you the ability to see different shades of light. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were in dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Languages. You speak, read, and write Common, Nesieve, and one additional language of your choice. Esper Initiate. You gain use of the aegis talent. At 3rd level, you gain the use of the innervate talent. At 5th level, you gain the use of the clean zone talent. These powers may each be used only once and you regain all uses after you finish a long rest. Sub-species. There are two primary types of eldori with traits often passed down by heritage. Subraces Lunar Eldori Solar Eldori Lorendi: The Harbingers of Shadow A large group of nesieve were affected differently by the awakening from their eldori counterparts. Embracing the power of destruction and darkness over balance, these nesieve became the militaristic society known as the lorendi, named after their ambitious leader, Loren Kaysa. They were banished from Eldor, to wander in their mission to conquer worlds beyond.

Elf Traits Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement. Ability Score Increase : Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age : Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. Alignment : Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. Size : Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium. Speed : Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision : Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keen Senses : You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Fey Ancestry : You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed , and magic can’t put you to sleep. Trance : Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Languages : You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires. Subraces High Elf As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. Ability Score Increase : Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Elf Weapon Training⁠ : You have proficiency with the longsword , shortsword , shortbow , and longbow . Cantrip : You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

The day’s march had been difficult, but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams. The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled city of Qualinost. Four slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glistening spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might overthrow the balance⁠. These glistening arches were the city’s only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness. —Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman, Dragons of Autumn Twilight Drizzt Do'Urden Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world. Slender and Graceful With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females. Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry. A Timeless Perspective Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless⁠. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance. Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy. Hidden Woodland Realms Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art object⁠s. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining). Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children. Exploration and Adventure Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elve⁠s also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and advent⁠uring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes. Elf Names Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names. On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation⁠, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.

They’re good folk, they care for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.” Humans. “All that haste, their ambition and drive to accomplish something before their brief lives pass away—human endeavors seem so futile sometimes.

Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children. A Timeless Perspective Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless⁠. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance. Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy. Exploration and Adventure Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. Elve⁠s also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and advent⁠uring allows them to do so. Elf Names Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names. Little distinction exists between male names and female names for elves of any age. On declaring adulthood, an elf selects a new name, although family and friends might continue to use the child name. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version. Elf Traits Your elf character has the following traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood⁠ and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

They are a slight people, lithe, quick, and agile. They are all children of nature, and even with their ancient culture and powerful magic, they still live close to the wilds as part of the Great Forest of Erethor. Most are a unified people, allied not to clan or family groups but instead to a single royal line that rules over all of Erethor. Their devotion to their Queen, Aradil, is akin to worship, and though there is a large and powerful council in the form of the High Court, it seldom opposes Aradil’s will. The elves of Erethor appear as varied as the woodlands they inhabit, with skin and hair ranging from the rich, dark brown of the ino tree to the pale hues of the alpine yew. Their eyes are universally large and dark, brimming with the weight of their long lives. The humans of Eredane say that the elves are universally beautiful, but it is a strange, ethereal beauty that is just as likely to disquiet as it is to attract. Despite their greater shared history and society, there remain various distinct cultures of elvenkind, each with its own unique ways of life.

They are the descendants of fae who wanted what humans could have: children and family, and thus a measure of Permanence. The price they had to pay for this was mortality. Since bearing children is almost impossible in the fae realm, and strictly forbidden to anyone but the queens anyway, they are stranded in the human realm and live their lives just as humans do, but usually hidden away in some form to prevent persecution. There are small communities of elves scattered about the world; in Italy, there are a few villages deep in the woods, and underground communities in the catacombs of Rome and Naples. A few elf families have settled in Pienza. Read about it in the chapter about the half-elves. Elves – Elfi Traits Languages. You speak the language of the country you live in as well as the elvish tongue, which is a bastardisation of the ancient Fae. Religion. The religious beliefs of the elves, while varying quite a bit between different communities, are usually centered on a mixture of either Christian, pantheistic or gnostic dogma with myths pertaining to the origin of the elves. In elven folklore, they are either cast-outs from the quasi-paradise of the fae realm to atone for their sins against the queen and her edicts (they are often known as the Malaparti, forced to live on the wrong side of the veil), or they see themselves as envoys of the “fallen” fae who have been punished with exile by the Lord, tasked with atoning for the queens’ deeds in averting God’s just punishment of the world. A few elven communities believe the Fae queens to be the creators of the world, and their offspring to be their quasi-angelic servants and messengers. According to the former belief, the fae are God’s servants tasked with protecting mankind, a belief that is actually somewhat close to the truth, considering the fae efforts to avert disasters as much as they can, so as not to imperil their Great Work of repairing the Sundering. According to the latter creed, the original elves living on Earth before the Great Flood averted a God-sent disaster with the help of their witchcraft. In response, God ripped the world in two and banished the elves to this new realm of swirling chaos, there to use their powers to fight with the untamed forces of nature for eternity while mankind endured the flood which cleansed it of its sins. Again, this belief is, in its own way, not too far from the truth. The task of those Earthbound elves following the second creed (who often call themselves “The Returned – Il Rimpatriati”) is to atone with good deeds and fear of God until such time that God has been swayed and their ancestors are forgiven. Most elves expect to go to the elven realm after they die, there to either dwell in bliss among God’s favored people (the fae) or wait for eventual divine forgiveness, depending on which version forms the basis of their beliefs. All other traits as described in the basic rules may be used. We do not use sub-species.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":30058},"publisher":"Vortex Verlag","book":"The Straight Way Lost"},{"name":"Ember Half-Orc","description":"Half-Orcs in the world Not all orcs on Virthys were as civilized as the Ember Orcs. And the more tribal savages had offspring with other races, in particular humans, just as on other worlds. During the War of Vallenis, many of them became mercenaries. Half-orc chieftains sometimes led their entire clans into war, for glory and treasure. The last few decades on Virthys are known to many orcs as the Days of Blood. While this allowed them to live as mighty warriors, the death toll was so high that the orcs have an ambivalent feeling to this time period. Some half-orcs found their way to more civilized lands, or even actively retreated from the bloodshed. And then there are, of course, the offspring of Ember Orcs with other races. The Ember Half-Orcs are seen as valuable members of society, and treated just as everyone else. The most common variant is offspring with humans. But Ember Half-Orcs with other races are also known. Ember Half-Orc Children of Ember Orcs and Humans, this race shares many traits with regular half-orcs. They have the same red skin as Ember Orcs, though, and the typical red or yellow eyes. Most of them grew up and live in the Ember Wastelands, but sometimes they (or their parents) journeyed off into the world.

Ability Score Increase: Intelligence+2, Constitution+1 Age: Ember Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years. Alignment: Ember Half-orcs are used to living together with Ember Orcs, elemental creatures, giants, humans and other races. They aren't treated very differently from Ember Orcs, although some of them still feel as outsiders. Most of them have a neutral alignment, but good and evil individuals are not only heard of: They are accepted in Ember Orc culture, as long as they don't limit other people's journey of self-development. Size: Ember Half-orcs are sometimes larger and bulkier than humans, many have a very similar body shape. They range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall, with little difference between male and female members of the race. Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision: Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Savage Attacks: When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

They resemble regular orcs in many ways, but they have also been strongly influenced by their relations to the Plane of Fire. Their skin is red, and many Ember Orcs also have red or yellow eyes. Their culture has risen beyond primitive tribes since a long time, and they live in cities built by master craftsmen and elemental magic. Their architecture incorporates lots of metal, but also gemstones, stained glass and fire magic made permanent. Towers and spiraling platforms that serve as home to dozens or even hundreds of smaller buildings are a common sight in the larger cities. Ember Orc cities are impressive and aesthetic in their own way, and you certainly won't find any skulls, dismembered heads or other primitive elements in the vicinity of a typical Ember Orc settlement. Living alongside denizens of the elemental planes for so long, magic and fire has become an important part of their society. Many Ember Orcs try to become spellcasters, and they are fascinated by foreign and exotic places. Planar exploration was a surprisingly common pastime in Ember Orc culture. There are also many extraordinary craftspersons in this society. In an Ember city, it's easy to find blacksmiths using arcane forges, gem cutters specializing in magical jewelry and artisans that become masters of their craft. When Ashandri was created, war erupted at the frontier between the Ember Wastelands and Delvaroth. And during the invasions of Va'Laeth, the orcs and other residents fought not only against the Laethian invaders, but those from Delvaroth, too. With that history in mind, most Ember Orcs consider humans, halflings and other races from the neighboring region as enemies. A few of them want to leave the old conflicts behind, but they are clearly a minority. They're mostly found at Sharloc's Trade or, less often, in the city of Hollow Market. A few of them also deliberately chose to travel other lands to find out more about foreign cultures and people. Kogar, Ember Orc and Chieftain of Sharloc's Trade Culture If you have a goal in life, shape yourself into a person who will achieve that goal. This philosophy is the center of life in the Ember Wastelands. Similar to traditional orc culture, strength is still an important factor. But inner strength, the ability to live through challenges and forge yourself into a better person, has replaced the old desire for battle strength. What better means, exactly, is still a matter of interpretation. Opposite to the Dreevith, Ember Orcs don't seek enlightenment (or at least, most of them don't). Their personal improvement is usually focused on becoming more resilient (physically and mentally), gaining new skills and getting a better rational understanding of the world. Academies and other training places are very common in their cities, but the Ember Orcs also consider daily activities as tasks to better themselves. Every book you read, every chore you make and every battle you fight turns you into a more capable person. And that's more important than any treasure. This desire for improvement doesn't stop with the individual. Their entire society is based on constantly changing and evolving. It takes more time, obviously, but whenever they realize something hinders the personal development of people, they try to change it. The one thing Ember Orcs are highly intolerant towards are people putting others down for their own profit or comfort. The concept of slavery is an atrocity to them, and they'll fight it whenever they get the chance. The downside of this philosophy is that those who truly can't care for themselves often fall through the cracks. Ember Orc culture lifts up those who can achieve things, but tends to turn a blind eye towards those who can't. This created a lot of tension after the apocalypse, when many people where overwhelmed with all they experienced, and failed to function as expected. Ember Orc equipment There are many master craftsmen among the Ember Orcs. It is quite common for them to work with fire or heat, sometimes even working together with entities from the elemental plane. Some of them craft powerful magic items, as well, and teach the techniques to their students. This has led to certain types of items becoming relatively common in the Ember Wastelands, such as the double-bladed Ember Sword. Many young warriors and adventurers in this region have one of these in their possession. A traditional Ember Sword Names Ember Orcs still retain their traditional names. But they like to add their greatest personal achievements as titles. An engineer might call himself Gruvog, Creator of Golems, while a sage could be named Craedor, Reader of a Thousand Books.

Or so the erina druids like to claim. The erina are a small-statured race of creatures resembling bipedal hedgehogs. They often escape the notice of the powerful rulers of Midgard, though anyone traveling through the wilds would do well to have them as allies. Curious Erina are a highly intelligent species, whose natural curiosity and cunning serve them well. They are always probing around the limits of their territory and keep a careful record of their environment. Erina seem supernaturally aware of their surroundings and have a keen eye for things that are out of place or novel. Scroungers Erina subsist by scrounging. In the wild, their diet consists of fruit, roots, insects, and small animals that come within range of their spears. The few erina who make their homes in the civilized centers live in much the same way. For this reason, erina sometimes run afoul of the law, though they are not naturally greedy. Defenders of Hearth and Home The erina generally worship the Hedge Mother, an erina goddess often associated with the elven goddess Holda (though the erina firmly state their worship of the Hedge Mother came long before the elves’ Holda existed), whose tenets regarding the defense of home align very well with the hedgehog-folk’s territorial nature. The burrows of the erina contain a dizzying number of tunnels and chambers with multiple camouflaged entrances and exits. Invading an erina burrow is a nightmarish experience, as the little defenders burrow over, under, and beside their enemies with alarming speed, striking from a freshly dug hole before retreating to safety. Erina Abroad Erina tend to live in large communities of their own kind. Occasionally, compatible fey creatures may lair near or even within an erina burrow. On occasion, some erina are so overcome with curiosity that they leave their homes to investigate the world beyond. These adventurous erina make excellent rangers and druids, exploring the unknown wilderness with a grin and a twitching nose. Other times, if there is a great threat to the region where the erina have dug their burrows, the defenders of the colony embark on a mission to face the danger nose-on. On rare occasions, some erina may find their actions warrant expulsion from the burrow. Erina are suspicious of warlocks and sorcerers, and members of the colony who make bargains with strange entities or who exhibit dangerous connections to powerful magic are often escorted out of the burrow. Erina Language Erina speak their own language, a series of whirring sounds punctuated by clicks. Erina can also communicate with other erina using only twitches of the nose and whiskers, though this old non-verbal language has fallen out of fashion in recent generations. Most burrows have at least one member who speaks the Common tongue. Erina Names Erina names translate very poorly into other languages. When outside erina lands, the hedgehog-folk tend to adopt names with long, open vowel sounds. These sounds are rare in their own language and bring pleasure to their ears.

It is even rumored that they can resist the effects of the blighted lands within the Empyrean. However, it is not so for these people beyond the borders of Anchorome. Most denizens of Faerun see little difference between them and other beasts, while those within the Feywild count them amongst the Unseelie. With hope, these faerie-kin shall one day be recognized as allies instead of adversaries. — Keritrina, sage of Dari Sinora There are those that exist between two worlds, whose very existence walks a fine line between the Material Plane and the Feywild. The feyblood are a product of the extraordinary union between a powerful fey spirit such as a dryad, sylph, or nereid, and a mortal. While most often mingled with elves or humans, it isn't unheard of for other types of fey and mortals to unite in similar fashion, and from this union, a child may be born with both a mortal coil and a fey spirit. Regardless, such unions are extremely rare, and often carry severe punishment for the fey parent. Amongst other races, the feyblood are viewed with suspicion and sometimes fear for the capricious nature of the fey, told throughout the Material Plane. Spirit of the Wild Similar to their fey parents, the feyblood share a special connection to their homeland. They too have tendency toward insatiable curiosity and wanderlust, rarely staying in any one place for a lengthy period of time. Feyblood aren't vain creatures, but can be mistaken as such. They are drawn to beauty, and often dress themselves in colorful silks and fabrics that lean toward the primordial nature of their parentage. They also delight in wearing unique trinkets that reflect the light of the sun or moon. Physically, Feyblood have slim, pointed ears and sharp features. They're slim-framed, often with slender hands and fingers. Their most prominent feature is their semi-translucent gossamer wings, which can vary in shape from butterfly-like to sharp, foliage-like features. They're almost always older than they appear. Even the starkest, most serious stare from a feyblood has a hint of childish playfulness hidden beneath. Their hair varies in color, usually anywhere from dusty blonde to deep browns and greens for the earthborn dryashi , or white, gray, silver, and shades of blues and browns for the skyborn sylphi . Their eyes are usually wider than normal, with colors varying between browns, greens, and reds. Their skin tones are similar to humans, but there are instances of some with greenish or bluish hues mixed within. Good Heart and Brave Soul While often viewed by others with great suspicion, feyblood still hold a love of life and strive to see the good in others whenever possible. They are far from being foolish in this aspect, however. Though they usually share a dislike for violence, they're staunch protectors of others, particularly those that also share an affinity for nature. They tend to keep only a few trusted friends and allies, though their loyalty to those chosen few is indisputable. Opposing Natures Because of their spiritual duality, the feyblood are caught between two worlds, neither of which accept them as true kin. Most fey view them as abominations, only rarely providing aid or guidance to those deemed to be a lesser species. They are only slightly more accepted amongst their other non-fey kin, though never entirely able to fit or be fully accepted into their world. Certain races are more accepting than others. Elves treat feyblood very much like other half-elves, for example, while gnomes are far more curious as to their shared connection with their fey kin. This is one of the main reasons why feyblood aren't often found in crowded places or areas of large public display. Feyblood Backgrounds Depending on their heritage, feyblood may tend toward certain backgrounds over others. Sylphi feyblood dislike being in confined spaces. They prefer living and traveling in the wilderness, particularly open areas such as plains, grasslands, and mountain peaks. Those that stay near large cities usually live on the outskirts or make their homes on the tops of the tallest structures. Common backgrounds include hermit, noble, or outlander. Dryashi feyblood prefer natural surroundings filled with as much life as possible. They feel most at home within forests, jungles, and brush-filled caverns, though they adapt just as well within populated areas, especially those with a variety of peoples and cultures. They avoid areas devoid of life, such as deserts and badlands, unless bent on rejuvenating these areas, such regions cause them incredible levels of distress and even nausea. Common backgrounds include entertainer, folk hero, or sage. Feyblood Names Feyblood use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to captures their heritage, and often begin and end with a vowel. Sample Female Names: Azema, Dedreve, Ephissa, Hathuni, Iaseli, Nesia, Othesni, Sheaya, Ulosani, Zesne Sample Male Names: Asezur, Cuyel, Eanoo, Fephil, Hivelo, Ilnavi, Kyves, Lissio, Omyth, Salire, Zeyul Feyblood Traits Feyblood have a variety of traits, inherited from their fey bloodline. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Most feyblood reach physical maturity only slightly slower than humans, reaching adulthood after 30 but retain a childlike wonder and youthful appearance. They live very long lives, reaching revered status as elders between 250 to 300 years old when they hope to return to the Feywild. Alignment. Feyblood tend to gravitate toward being good-aligned, but there are quite a few that are neutral as well. It is extremely rare that one would become either lawful or evil, barring extraordinary circumstances. Size. Somewhat shorter than humans, feyblood can reach about 4 to 5 feet in height. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Fey Charm. You can target one humanoid or beast that you can see within 30 feet. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, with a DC equal to 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failure, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. Although the target isn't under your control, it takes your requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. You can’t use this feature again until you complete a long rest. Fey Resistance. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and against illusion magic. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Sylvan, and one extra language of your choice.

While perfectly able to live their whole lives out of the water, Finfolk feel most at home in watery environments, often seen gracefully swimming or hunting for fish in the ocean. Human in appearance, Finfolk have smooth skin and very little body hair compared to their land-dwelling cousins. Their ears have two enlarged pointed helices, which allow them to perceive sounds easily, especially underwater. Finfolk also have nearly imperceptible gills at the base of their neck, allowing them to both breathe and speak underwater. The most notable difference of the Finfolk compared to other Human variants are their webbed fingers and toes, which can vary in prominence from person to person, as well as their slightly pointed teeth, both known to be adaptations to their genes over thousands of years living off the ocean. Additionally, their skin tone has the broadest range of colors, from silvery white, blue, and green to various shades of pinks and browns, to blues and the deepest black, each genetically passed down from the areas of the seas and lakes where their ancestors lived. Traditional Finfolk homes are often in the shallower parts of the ocean, usually within a mile of the coast, due to the safety and temperature of the water. However, more and more Finfolk have begun to live on land, in shoreline bluffs and seaside caves or even in larger villages and cities when they want a change of pace and scenery. Their clothing is often light and made from seaweed, netting, and found objects, and their armor is fashioned from shells and discarded metals found underwater. However, Finfolk often travel for adventure and may wear the fashions of the towns they visit to blend in. No matter how far they stray from home, though, finfolk are drawn to the water, dreaming of its playful waves and the salty sea air. Blessed by the Waves Many Finfolk believe that the Wardlings of their species are blessed by the ocean’s waves. A ritual of the Finfolk involves blessing their infants in the waters of their homeland to encourage DexMya to fill the baby with Oor, calling upon the creatures of the waters to send their mightiest guardians to become their child’s familiar. A fruitful ritual is said to also cause more prominent webbing on a Finfolk’s hands and feet as they grow, which is seen as good fortune passed down by the twin gods. While this has no actual bearing on the magical ability of the child, it does make them more agile and athletic in the water, though all finfolk are excellent swimmers. Finfolk Names Modern trends after years of assimilation into land-dwelling human culture have resulted in Common first names for Finfolk children, while keeping the family’s surnames, which are typically derivatives of Aquan. However, while traveling among those not of Finfolk ancestry, most use a Common translation of their surname as well, as Aquan is difficult for those who do not speak it fluently to pronounce.

In a firbolg’s eyes, there is no greater fault than greed. The firbolgs believe that the world remains healthiest when each creature takes only what it needs. Material goods, especially precious gems and gold, have little appeal to them. What use are such things when winter lingers and food runs short? Natural Druids Firbolgs have a talent for druidic magic. Their cultural reverence for nature, combined with their strong and insightful minds, makes learning such magic an instinctive part of their development. Almost every firbolg learns a few spells, typically those used to mask their presence, and many go on to master nature magic. Firbolgs who become druids serve as stronghold leaders. With every action the tribe takes, the druids weigh not only the group’s needs, but the effect each action will have on the forest and the rest of the natural world. Firbolg tribes would rather go hungry than strain the land during a famine. Hidden Shepherds As caretakers of the land, firbolgs prefer to remain out of sight and out of mind. They don’t try to dominate nature, but rather seek to ensure that it prospers and survives according to its own laws. Firbolgs use their magic to keep their presence in a forest secret. This approach allows them to avoid the politics and struggles of elves, humans, and orcs. Such events concern the firbolgs only when the events affect the forest. Even in the face of an intrusion, firbolgs prefer a subtle, gentle approach to prevent damage to their territory. They employ their magic to make the forest an unappealing place to explore by temporarily diverting springs, driving away game, stealing critical tools, and altering trails to leave hunting or lumber parties hopelessly lost. The firbolgs’ presence is marked by an absence of animals and a strange quiet, as if the forest wishes to avoid attracting attention to itself. The faster travelers decide to move on, the better. If these tactics fail, the firbolgs take more direct action. Their observations of a settlement determine what happens next. If the outsiders seem peaceful, the firbolgs approach and gently ask them to leave, even offering food and other supplies to aid their departure. If those who insist on remaining respect nature, take only what they need, and live in harmony with the wood, firbolgs explore the possibility of friendship with them, as long as the outsiders vow to safeguard the forest. If the settlers clearly display evil intentions, however, the firbolgs martial their strength and magic for a single overwhelming attack. Outcast Adventurers As guardians of the wood, few firbolgs would dream of leaving their homes or attempting to fit into human society. An exiled firbolg, or one whose clan has been destroyed, might not have a choice in the matter. Most adventuring firbolgs fall into this latter category. Outcast firbolgs can never return home. They committed some unforgivable deed, usually something that put their homeland at risk, such as starting a forest fire or killing a rare or beautiful wild creature. These firbolgs are loners who wander the world in hope of finding a new place to call home. Orphaned firbolgs are those whose clans or homelands have been destroyed. They become crusaders for nature, seeking to avenge their loss and prevent the further destruction of the natural world. A few rare firbolgs are entrusted by their clan with an important mission that takes them beyond their homes. These firbolgs feel like pilgrims in a strange land, and usually they wish only to complete their quests and return home as quickly as possible. The Firbolg Adventurers table can serve as inspiration for determining why a firbolg character leaves home. Firbolg Adventurers d8 Reason for Adventuring 1 Outcast for murder 2 Outcast for severely damaging home territory 3 Clan slain by invading humanoids 4 Clan slain by a dragon or demon 5 Separated from the tribe and lost 6 Homeland destroyed by natural disaster 7 Personal quest ordained by omens 8 Dispatched on a quest by tribe leaders Firbolg Names Firbolg adopt elven names when they must deal with outsiders, although the concept of names strikes them as strange. They know the animals and plants of the forest without formal names, and instead identify the forest’s children by their deeds, habits, and other actions. By the same token, their tribe names merely refer to their homes. When dealing with other races, firbolgs refer to their lands by whatever name the surrounding folk use, as a matter of tact and hospitality, but among their own kind they simply call it “home.” Sometimes firbolgs adopt the nicknames or titles outsiders give them under the assumption that those who need names can call them whatever they wish.

Most firbolgs live in extended family units, and it is unusual to find one living alone. However, they are introverted to the point where they seldom engage with other firbolgs outside the family unit, and firbolgs rarely form their own cities, villages, or even large tribes.

Of the birdfolk, they are the most likely to be found living among the humblefolk. Gallus have a deep respect for nature and a love of gardening unmatched by other birdfolk. They value their social bonds above all else, and are always ready to help their neighbors and promote the common good. They are polite but have little patience for deceit and rudeness. A Varied Folk The gallus are a varied folk, resembling as many different varieties of wildfowl as there are trees in the Wood. Some are pheasant-like, others are grouse-like, while some resemble chickens or turkeys. There are dozens of variations of feathers, colors, and patterns even between gallus of the same subrace. The gallus are proud of their appearances but not to the point of vanity. Maintaining good grooming is akin to keeping a knife sharp and shows a level of respect for oneself. Birdfolk are generally welcoming to other races, but the gallus are particularly well-known for their willingness to include virtually anyone in social or familial groups. In gallus culture, it is customary to always offer your seat at a table to guests. This is seen as the basis of a popular and hilarious children’s story about a meal growing too cold to eat as the gallus continually give up their seats to late arrivals at a party. Salt of the Earth Gallus are a social and communal folk. They tend to form close-knit communities wherever they roost, and their sense of pride for their community runs deep. When tragedy leaves children in their village orphaned, it is customary for gallus families to take them in. Gallus value honest work, such as farming and smithing, and share labor equally between all community members. There is nothing a gallus would not give to their neighbors in a time of need. While other birdfolk might look down on gallus for their common ways, the gallus have excellent interpersonal skills.

Many devote themselves to civil service, others to their gods. Some dedicate their extraordinarily long lives to the pursuit of knowledge. A few, naturally, seek out lives of adventure. The gearforged are an artificial race. More importantly, its members are created one at a time and come from a vast array of backgrounds. Nevertheless, they maintain rich traditions of history, culture, and spirituality all their own, largely because of the influence of the race’s patron, the gear goddess Rava. Form and Function All gearforged were once other creatures with flesh‑and‑blood bodies, but their conscious minds were transplanted into articulated bodies of iron, steel, brass, and wood, driven by pistons and springs. Each is as distinctive in appearance as other people are. Some entities spend a fortune on these new bodies, while others scrape together anything that will work—especially if the subject is aging or ill. All gearforged are made in humanoid shape. The vast majority fall into one of two styles: those that are roughly human-sized, with articulated joints, hands, feet, and crystal lens eyes; and a version made by dwarves that mirrors their shorter, stouter body shape. Dwarflike gearforged are more common in the cantons of the Ironcrags than in the Free City of Zobeck, but they’re universally accepted as receptacles for dwarf souls. Gearforged mechanisms are more than mechanical, because gearforged are machines with souls. Their arms and legs are driven by everwound springs. Their minds are actuated by memory gears, transverse cognition gearing, and the marvel of a soul gem connected directly to a maze of silver and mithral steam, spark, and magical conduits. These elements reside in a shell of iron, brass, and steel. Gearforged Components The range of gearforged anatomy in all its variants is remarkable, but all gearforged share some common parts. Everwound Springs. These magical springs provide energy over long periods, effectively acting as the power sources for most of the gearforged’s moving parts. A broken everwound spring results in the loss of function in that digit or limb. Soul Gem. The mind of a gearforged creature is as sharp as that of any flesh-and-blood soul, but it is more portable. The animating, vital principle of a gearforged—its will, its personality, its mind—are retained in a soul gem. Its destruction means the death of that gearforged. Memory Gears. These delicate constructions are scroll‑like ribbons pierced with thousands of pin holes and wound about with tiny enchantments of great complexity. The memory of a gearforged for all the days after its creation lives in the memory gears. Older gearforged have many such gears, and the material component for the magic to create them requires one new gear for every 10 years of life. Installing one requires one day’s work and 2,000 gp. Other gearforged can read memory gears salvaged from a dead gearforged, but it’s a complex, time-consuming process. It’s also viewed with some alarm by most gearforged, since it is akin to peering into the most private details of a creature’s life. Installing a used memory gear into a new or existing gearforged requires a new soulforging and at least one week before the recipient can interpret and understand the memories. Gearforged Names Some gearforged use the same name they had before they became gearforged. Others adopt a new name, drawing on any culture they admire. And a few take on an aspirational name representing a virtue they hope to embody, such as Courage, Noble, Faithful, Endurance, or Truth. Gearforged Traits Your gearforged character has certain characteristics in common with all other gearforged. Ability Score Increase. Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. Age. The soul inhabiting a gearforged can be any age. As long as its new body is kept in good repair, there is no known limit to how long it can function. Alignment. No single alignment typifies gearforged. Size. Gearforged are as tall as either dwarves or humans, but they weigh between 250 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Type. You are of the humanoid (gearforged) type. Constructed Body. Your consciousness and soul reside within a soul gem to animate your mechanical body. As such, you are a living creature with some of the benefits and drawbacks of a construct. You cannot eat, drink, or breathe. You can’t drink potions or gain benefits that come from drinking, eating, or inhaling vapors. You do not naturally sleep. During a rest, you must perform maintenance on your gears, springs, and joints, following the normal rules governing rest and activity. While performing this maintenance, you are aware of your surroundings but you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. If you go longer than 24 hours without performing maintenance (you don’t take a long rest), you gain one level of exhaustion. All exhaustion gained this way disappears after your next long rest. You can’t be stabilized when dying with a Wisdom (Medicine) check or spare the dying. Instead, a successful DC 10 Intelligence check or a mending cantrip is needed. You regain only one-half the usual number of hit points from spells or magical effects with the words cure, heal, or healing in their titles. Flesh of Steel. You are immune to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition. Solid Construction. If you are killed but your soul gem and memory gears are still intact, you can be restored to life if your body is repaired and soulforging is cast on it again. Because the body already exists, the cost of the ritual is just 500 gp, plus the cost of repairing the body (GM’s discretion, typically 1d4 x 50 gp). If your body was destroyed but your soul gem and memory tapes are intact, they can be implanted into a new body at the standard cost (10,000 gp). The only other magic capable of bringing you back from the dead is a wish spell, which restores you fully. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Machine Speech and Common.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Gearforged","description":"Originally created as powerful soldiers, gearforged must now find their own paths to navigate the second life they’ve been given. Many devote themselves to civil service, others to their gods. Some dedicate their extraordinarily long lives to the pursuit of knowledge. A few, naturally, seek out lives of adventure. The gearforged are an artificial race. More importantly, its members are created one at a time and come from a vast array of backgrounds. Nevertheless, they maintain rich traditions of history, culture, and spirituality all their own. Form and Function All gearforged were once other creatures with flesh-and-blood bodies, but their conscious minds were transplanted into articulated bodies of iron, steel, brass, and wood, driven by pistons and springs. Each is as distinctive in appearance as other people are. Some entities spend a fortune on these new bodies, while others scrape together anything that will work—especially if the subject is aging or ill. All gearforged are made in humanoid shape, often in the likeness of the person’s original race. The vast majority of gearforged are created from and shaped like humans, who were the first creators of gearforged. Gearforged have articulated joints, hands, feet, and crystal-lens eyes. Gearforged mechanisms are more than mechanical, because gearforged are machines with souls. Their arms and legs are driven by everwound springs. Their minds are actuated by memory gears, transverse cognition gearing, and the marvel of a soul gem connected directly to a maze of silver and mithral steam, spark, and magical conduits. These elements reside in a shell of iron, brass, and steel. Gearforged Components The range of gearforged anatomy in all its variants is remarkable, but all gearforged share some common parts. Everwound Springs. These magical springs provide energy over long periods, effectively acting as the power sources for most of the gearforged’s moving parts. A broken everwound spring results in the loss of function in that digit or limb, much like a damaged joint or ligaments in a flesh-and-blood creature. Soul Gem. The mind of a gearforged creature is as sharp as that of any flesh-and-blood soul, but it is more portable. The animating, vital principle of a gearforged—its will, its personality, its mind—are retained in a soul gem. The destruction of this gem means the death of that gearforged. Memory Gears. These delicate constructions are scroll-like ribbons pierced with thousands of pin holes and wound about with tiny enchantments of great complexity.

Installing a new memory gear requires one day’s work and 2,000 gp. Other gearforged can read memory gears salvaged from a dead gearforged, but it’s a complex, time-consuming process. It’s also viewed with some alarm by most gearforged, since it is akin to peering into the most private details of a creature’s life. When a used memory gear is installed in a new or existing gearforged, the process takes three days’ work to avoid damaging the memories in the gear, and it takes one week before the recipient can fully interpret and understand the memories.

The soul inhabiting a gearforged can be any age. As long as its new body is kept in good repair, there is no known limit to how long it can function. Alignment. No single alignment typifies gearforged, but most gearforged maintain the alignment they had before becoming gearforged. Size. Your size is determined by your Race Chassis. Speed. Your base walking speed is determined by your Race Chassis. Construct Resilience. Your body is constructed, which frees you from some of the limits of flesh-and-blood creatures. You have resistance to poison damage, you are immune to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned. Construct Vitality. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe, and you don’t sleep the way most creatures do. Instead, you enter a dormant state where you resemble a statue and remain semiconscious for 6 hours a day. During this time, the magic in your soul gem and everwound springs slowly repairs the day’s damage to your mechanical body. While in this dormant state, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Living Construct. Your consciousness and soul reside within a soul gem to animate your mechanical body. As such, you are a living creature with some of the benefits and drawbacks of a construct. Though you can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds , you can also be affected by game effects that specifically target constructs, such as the shatter spell. As long as your soul gem remains intact, game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, repairing the damaged pieces of your mechanical body (restoring lost sections only if the spell normally restores lost limbs) and returning you to life as a gearforged. Alternatively, if your body is destroyed but your soul gem and memory gears are intact, they can be installed into a new body with a ritual that takes one day and 10,000 gp worth of materials. If your soul gem is destroyed, only a wish spell can restore you to life, and you return as a fully living member of your original race. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Machine Speech (a whistling, clicking language that’s incomprehensible to non-gearforged ears), and a language associated with your Race Chassis. Race Chassis. Four races are known to create unique gearforged, building mechanical bodies similar in size and shape to their people: dwarf, gnome, human, and kobold. Choose one of these forms.

Theirs are the wonders of the mind, the force of will, the brilliant light of insight, and the resounding echo of discovery—but also the desiccation of despair. Gem Dragonborn Traits You have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size. You are Medium. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Gem Ancestry. You have a gem dragon ancestor, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one kind of dragon from the Gem Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits, as shown in the table. Breath Weapon. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Gem Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Draconic Resistance. You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Gem Ancestry. Psionic Mind. You can send telepathic messages to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand these messages, but it must be able to understand at least one language to comprehend them. Gem Flight. Starting at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest spectral wings on your body. These wings last for 1 minute.

It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals. The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time. The powerful genies, however, do not face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit—whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito. During these visits, a mortal might catch a genie’s eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal–genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that’s lain dormant for generations. Occasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi. Heirs to Elemental Power Genasi inherit something from both sides of their dual nature. They resemble humans but have unusual skin color (red, green, blue, or gray), and there is something odd about them. The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each genasi, often as magical power. Seen in silhouette, a genasi can usually pass for human. Those of earth or water descent tend to be heavier, while those of air or fire tend to be lighter. A given genasi might have some features reminiscent of the mortal parent (pointed ears from an elf, a stockier frame and thick hair from a dwarf, small hands and feet from a halfling, exceedingly large eyes from a gnome, and so on). Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all. Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered. A few genasi leave the Material Plane to find refuge in the households of their genie parents. Wild and Confident Genasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such self-confidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble. Too much failure can chip away at even a genasi’s sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft. Genasi Lands As rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi seldom have communities of their own and typically adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people. Those living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends. Facing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground. Most air and fire genasi in the Realms are descendants of the djinn and efreet who once ruled Calimshan. When those rulers were overthrown, their planetouched children were scattered. Over thousands of years, the bloodlines of those genasi have spread into other lands. Though far from common, air and fire genasi are more likely to be found in the western regions of Faerûn, along the coast from Calimshan north up to the Sword Coast, and into the Western Heartlands to the east. Some remain in their ancient homeland. In contrast, water and earth genasi have no common history. Individuals have difficulty tracing their own lineage, and bloodlines occasionally skip a generation or two. Many earth genasi originated in the North and spread out from there. Water genasi come from coastal areas, the largest concentration of them hailing from the regions surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars. The distant land of Zakhara is known only in legends to most inhabitants of Faerûn. There, genies and spellcasters enter into bargains, and genasi can result from such pacts. Those genasi have been sources of great weal and woe in the history of that land. Genasi Names Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx. Genasi on Athas Although any world that includes one or more elemental planes can feature genasi, on Athas, the world of the Dark Sun campaign setting, elemental forces hold greater sway than they do on other worlds. As a people touched by elemental power, genasi are viewed as seers, prophets, and chosen ones. The birth of a genasi, whether a slave, a noble, or a member of a desert tribe, is an auspicious event. Most Athasians believe a given genasi is destined for greatness—or infamy. Genasi Traits Your genasi character has certain characteristics in common with all other genasi. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age. Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years. Alignment. Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment. Size. Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans, standing anywhere from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants. Subraces. Four major subraces of genasi are found among the worlds of D&D: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these subraces. Genasi Backgrounds Each genasi subrace has its own temperament, which might make some backgrounds more suitable than others. Air genasi are proud of their heritage, sometimes to the point of haughtiness. They can be flamboyant, and are keen to have an audience. They rarely stay in one place for long, always looking for a new sky to see and breathe. Air genasi who don’t live in cities favor open lands such as plains, deserts, and high mountains. Fitting backgrounds include charlatan, entertainer, and noble. Earth genasi are more withdrawn, and their connection to the earth keeps them from being comfortable in most cities. Their uncommon size and strength makes them natural soldiers, though, and with their stoic demeanor, they can encourage others and become great leaders. Many earth genasi live underground, where they can be in their favored element. When they emerge from their caves, they might roam the hills and mountains or lay claim to old ruins. Appropriate backgrounds for earth genasi include hermit, outlander, and soldier. Fire genasi often get themselves into difficulty with their fiery tempers. Like their air genasi cousins, they sometimes flaunt their perceived superiority over common folk. But they also want others to share their high opinion of themselves, so they constantly seek to enhance their reputations. Likely backgrounds for a fire genasi include criminal, folk hero, and noble. Water genasi almost all have some experience aboard or around sea vessels. They make excellent mariners and fishers. Like earth genasi, though, water genasi prefer quiet and solitude; the wide shores are their natural homes. They go where they want, do what they want, and rarely feel bound to anything. Good backgrounds for water genasi include hermit and sailor.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Princes of the Apocalypse"},{"name":"Genasi","description":"Genasi are exceedingly rare on Exandria, as befits their unique origins. Most live among the elementally attuned Ashari tribes of Tal’Dorei or on the Elemental Planes. However, there are no major rifts to the Elemental Planes in Wildemount, and thus no Ashari to safeguard them. The few genasi who dwell on this continent are often created as the result of a powerful elemental influence at the moment of their birth. A baby born within the eye of a hurricane might become an air genasi, while a fire genasi might be born in the midst of a raging forest fire. Some genasi are more attuned to their native element than others. A genasi with a powerful connection to elemental fire might have their head covered by crackling flames rather than hair. A genasi with a connection to elemental water might have blue-tinged skin and appear to sweat profusely at all times. Genasi in the Dwendalian Empire Genasi are so visually distinctive and uncommon that they are treated with equal amounts of surprise and wonder in all the nations of Wildemount. The authoritarian regime of the Dwendalian Empire reacts the most harshly to the unique power of genasi, and the Cerberus Assembly takes the greatest interest in them. Genasi are often press-ganged into joining the assembly under threat of death or exile, and most accept the offer. Those who refuse—and who survive—often take refuge in the empire’s criminal underworld, with many finding acceptance in the Myriad crime syndicate. Genasi on the Menagerie Coast Even the cosmopolitan people of the Clovis Concord react to the sight of a genasi with wonder. Sailors and pirates alike take special interest in genasi, for the power to harness the elements is a gift from the gods on the open sea.

There are four major subraces of genasi: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these subraces. Air Genasi As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long. Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1. Unending Breath. You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not incapacitated. Mingle with the Wind. You can cast the levitate spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Earth Genasi As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you aren’t necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action. Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1. Earth Walk. You can move across difficult terrain made of earth and stone without expending extra movement. Pass without Trace. You can cast the pass without trace spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Fire Genasi As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it. Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens spot actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Your ties to the Elemental Plane of Fire make your darkvision unusual: everything you see in darkness is a shade of red. Fire Resistance. You have resistance to fire damage. Reach to the Blaze. You know the produce flame cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast burning hands as a 1st-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Water Genasi The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths—these things call to your heart as a descendant of the turbulent marids. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish. Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi’s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Acid Resistance. You have resistance to acid damage. Amphibious. You can breathe air and water. Swim. You have a swimming speed of 30 feet. Call to the Wave. You know the shape water cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast create or destroy water as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest.

Some have smooth skin, while others have short bristles on their faces and the tops of their heads. As beings of impressive size and unforgettable appearance, giff are noticed wherever they go. Giff put their great size to use in all sorts of ways, from lifting heavy loads and tying tight knots to opening stuck doors and seeing over crowds. They're also natural swimmers. Most giff believe they originated on one world, but their home world is now the stuff of legend, because no living giff has seen it or knows where it is. The divine beings who created giff have likewise been forgotten. Their titanic petrified bodies drift on the Astral Sea, isolated and unrecognizable in their current forms. Although they don’t realize it, giff are drawn to the Astral Plane because, on a deep psychic level, they remain connected to their creator gods, who have just enough divine spark left in them to imbue giff with sparks of their own, which giff have learned to channel through their weapons. Most giff have no idea where this so-called astral spark comes from, but they feel its presence most strongly when they are in Wildspace or the Astral Sea. Giff are split into two camps concerning how their name is pronounced. Half of them say it with a hard g, half with a soft g. Disagreements over the correct pronunciation often blossom into hard feelings, loud arguments, and head-butting contests, but they rarely escalate beyond that.

Almost as numerous as the gifted themselves, the traditions regarding their birth and the reason for their unique powers, innate or otherwise, include being: descendants of a malebranche or a turquoise; conceived during special planetary conjunctions; seventh children of seventh children; born with a silver spoon in their mouth; born prematurely; blessed by saints; marked by the Quinotaur; swapped in the cradle by elves; born in Mala Tempora (the darkest period of the year), on Mortal Night or during a lightning storm; chosen by the Prophecies; or delivered when their mother sneezed in the vegetable garden: old wives’ tales and legends are rife with children born with special powers. The gifted can be all of this and more. Fun Nicknames: whizkids, merlins, zataros, paragnostics. Typical Names: generally the same as humans’, though sometimes the gifted take on stage names or are given nicknames based on their physical peculiarities or powers. How Other Races See Them Because of the insidious and covert powers and more or less visible exceptional traits of the gifted, the first reaction of ordinary people toward them is often one of mistrust, if not outright suspicion: the farmer’s daughter with the fiery-red hair or the blazing-eyed wanderer could be heretics, sorcerers, or jinxes who bring nothing but trouble. Truth be told, in a world full of hogwash, brutes, and freaks, gifted who mind their own business are the lesser evil for commoners. In fact, a well-meaning individual with some special magical talent is often seen as a potential blessing. Gifted Traits Ability Score Increase. Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. You may have more or less evident physical peculiarities of your choice related to this trait. Age. The life expectancy of a gifted is identical to that of a human, but sometimes the gift you receive consumes your life energies much earlier or preserves them much longer. Size. Gifted are the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Magical Influence. You choose a school of magic: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. You learn a cantrip and a 1st level spell from the chosen school. You can cast those spells at their lower level once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can choose Charisma or Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for these spells. Magical Resonance. At the end of a short rest, you can choose to regain a 1st level spell slot.

While deceptively short, a whoop includes a range of ultrasonic inflections that indicate clan, a personal identifier, and a suggestion of family affiliation (the Znir trace lineage through the mother). Because it’s impossible for most non-gnolls to properly replicate a whoop, gnolls also use contract names—names intended to be used with clients and other outsiders. There is a basic structure of contract names used by all gnolls; the inflection of the name indicates gender, though few people recognize this if they don’t speak Gnoll. The Znir typically attach clan name to a formal introduction: “Ghyrryn Barrakas, Znir.” Gnoll Contract Names: Dagnyr, Dhyrn, Ghyrryn, Gnasc, Gnoryc, Gnyrn, Gnyrl, Hyrn, Lhoryn, Lhyr, Lhyrl, Mognyr, Myrl, Sorgnyn, Thyrn, Toryc, Yrgnyn, Yrych","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":20973},"publisher":"Keith Baker Presents","book":"Exploring Eberron"},{"name":"Gnome","description":"Skinny and flaxen-haired, his skin walnut brown and his eyes a startling turquoise, Burgell stood half as tall as Aeron and had to climb up on a stool to look out the peephole. Like most habitations in Oeble, that particular tenement had been built for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting awkwardness as best they could. But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear. The front room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks, tinted lenses, jeweler’s loupes, and jars of powdered and shredded ingredients for casting s⁠pells. A fat gray cat, the mage’s familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its eyes, gave Aeron a disdainful yellow stare, then appeared to go back to sleep. —Richard Lee Byers, The Black Bouquet A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes⁠ take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation⁠, and play. Vibrant Expression A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome’s insatiable interest in everything around. A gnome’s personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome’s beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome’s clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels. Delighted Dedication As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes⁠ seem to worry that even with all that time, they can’t get in enough of the things they want to do and see. Gnomes speak as if they can’t get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way. Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they’re just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes⁠ are skilled⁠ engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They’re willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large. Bright Burrows Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place. Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Some human families retain gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life. Gnome Names Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome’s mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are “stuffy” about names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that’s the most fun to say. Male Names: Alston, Alvyn, Boddynock, Brocc, Burgell, Dimble, Eldon, Erky, Fonkin, Frug, Gerbo, Gimble, Glim, Jebeddo, Kellen, Namfoodle, Orryn, Roondar, Seebo, Sindri, Warryn, Wrenn, Zook Female Names: Bimpnottin, Breena, Caramip, Carlin, Donella, Duvamil, Ella, Ellyjobell, Ellywick, Lilli, Loopmottin, Lorilla, Mardnab, Nissa, Nyx, Oda, Orla, Roywyn, Shamil, Tana, Waywocket, Zanna Clan Names: Beren, Daergel, Folkor, Garrick, Nackle, Murnig, Ningel, Raulnor, Scheppen, Timbers, Turen Nicknames: Aleslosh, Ashhearth, Badger, Cloak, Doublelock, Filchbatter, Fnipper, Ku, Nim, Oneshoe, Pock, Sparklegem, Stumbleduck Seeing the World Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes⁠ take to adventuring⁠ as a quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes⁠ who adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great annoyance of their adventuring⁠ companions. Always Appreciative It’s rare for a gnome to be hostile or malicious unless he or she has suffered a grievous injury. Gnomes know that most races don’t share their sense of humor, but they enjoy anyone’s company just as they enjoy everything else they set out to do.

Though it is well-known that they share ancient kin with the dwarves, even the Kurgun do not like to claim responsibility for the lineage. Gnomes are barely taller than halflings, with only a slightly stouter build. They are bronze skinned but pale eyed, with jet-black hair that they keep short, as they are constantly in and out of the water. Gnomish culture and history reflect their adaptable nature. Their nimble outlook on life allowed them to first move from mountain life to that of the coastal hills of the Ebon Sea, and from there to become adroit seafarers and river runners. Though they were forced to flee before the onslaught of the Dornish invasion, their solicitous demeanors and mercenary hearts allowed them to return to their conquerors bearing little ill will and offering their services as merchants and guides. The gnomes even welcomed the Sarcosans, knowing that they could stand to make a profit as the newcomers’ liaisons to the fey. Through all these years and new trading partners, the gnomes always knew that their conquerors longed only for land and goods. With the coming of Izrador, this has not been the case. They cannot fool themselves into believing that the fallen god and his minions will be content to let the survivors of the war live their lives in peace. Whatever the eventual goals of the Shadow, the gnomes know that Eredane cannot survive the heavy-plated burden of his orcs and the dark mantle of his legates. But the river fey’s strength was not in war. So, as always, they bowed before their new masters and offered to serve. Or so it seemed. Though the gnomes have been subjugated along with the halflings, they continue to enjoy a sort of freedom. Even the forces of the Shadow need to transport cargo and soldiers, and the river barges of the gnomes suit this purpose well. Izrador’s orcs and legates suffer the existence of the gnome barges as long as they move only cargoes in Izrador’s name, while the traitor princes and the false sussars give them free reign as long as they receive the first pick of choice goods from afar. Most other former free peoples see the cost of this semi-freedom as the worst kind of enemy collaboration. What few realize is that the gnomes fight the fallen god in their own way: as consummate spies and smugglers. It is their secret trade that keeps weapons, magic, and information flowing among the former free peoples of Eredane. Eredane’s gnomes wear loose pants and garish vests marked with the trader seal of their family. Rafters carry sharp daggers hidden in their belts and use small crossbows to spear pike or to protect their crews from hungry river eels. When they get the odd chance to turn their crossbows on the occasional minion of the Shadow, the weapons prove both stealthy and lethal.

The earliest gnomes were seldom seen by other folk due to the gnomes’ secretive nature and their propensity for living in forests and burrows. What they lacked in size, they made up for in cleverness. They confounded predators with traps and labyrinthine tunnels. They also learned magic from gods like Garl Glittergold, Baervan Wildwanderer, and Baravar Cloakshadow, who visited them in disguise. That magic eventually created the lineages of forest gnomes and rock gnomes. Gnomes are petite folk with big eyes and pointed ears, who live around 425 years. Many gnomes like the feeling of a roof over their head, even if that “roof” is nothing more than a hat. Gnome Traits As a Gnome, you have these special traits. Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Gnomish Cunning. You have Advantage on Intelligence , Wisdom , and Charisma saving throws . Gnomish Lineage. You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose one of the following options; whichever one you choose, Intelligence , Wisdom , or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage): Forest Gnome. You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. You also always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus , and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest . You can also use any spell slots you have to cast the spell. Rock Gnome. You know the Mending and Prestidigitation cantrips. In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting Prestidigitation to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation ; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell’s ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn’t do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a Utilize action.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":32231},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Player's Handbook (2024)"},{"name":"Gobboc","description":"“I think I’ll call you McNugget.” - Ur-Gahl, Orc Adventurer Nestled in secluded clearings in the woods, on hilltops with extraordinary vantages, or in easily collapsible canyons, gobbocs (go-BOC) seek safety above all else. Survival is a gobboc’s watchword; their own survival is their number one goal on expedition—treasure, glory, and saving the world be damned. Brave Cowards You’ll likely recognise the back of a gobboc’s head more than the front, given their propensity to run away at the first sign of danger. While this is the epitome of cowardice, it is a specifically brave kind of cowardice; life is scary and living another day is the bravest thing you can do. At least, this is what is taught to gobboc from the moment they can walk, a few hours after they’re born. A typical gobboc is never the first to enter a room nor the last in a line of dungeon delvers. They aim to keep bodies firmly before and behind them, a tactical meat shield to ward off harm. Indeed, gobbocs are the ultimate hit-and-run fighters, retreating from a foe before it can retaliate against their precise and lightning-quick attacks. This method of fighting, taught to all gobbocs, is known as the Klucking Fighting Creed. Fit and Sit Gobbocs have a peculiar tendency to sit on things. The pinnacle of this innate desire is the Festival of Brooding, sometimes known as the Eggstravaganza. This annual event finds all the gobbocs in a town creating the most comfortable thrones, bean bag chairs, and bundles of straw possible before sitting on them around a huge bonfire. There are no fireworks; sudden, loud noises are frowned upon in gobboc society. Avian Ascendency Gobbocs worship other birds. The bigger the bird, the more holy it is. In fact, similarly to kobolds, gobboc belief is innately magical. It is so potent that gobboc belief causes birds to become more intelligent. In times of war, gobboc hosts are often accompanied by flocks of birds: razor-clawed and quick-witted cassowaries form cavalry divisions, while flying contingents are composed of super-intelligent hippogriffs. It is widely posited that the famous gobboc playwright Owlfred Hatchcluck based his play, The Birds , on this uniquely gobboc occurrence. Gobboc Traits As a gobboc, you have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and either your Charisma score or Wisdom score increases by 1 (your choice). Age . Gobbocs grow quickly and die young. They walk hours after hatching, reach adulthood by age 7, and live around 30 years. Languages . You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Size . Gobbocs are a diminutive race and stand on average 2 to 3 feet tall. Your size is Small. Speed . Your base walking speed is 25 feet . Commune with Fowl Folk . You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with feathered beasts and monstrosities. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all checks you make to influence them. Coward’s Creed . After successfully hitting with a melee attack, you can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. Feathered . Your light bones and feathered form reduce the impact of gravity; you take only half damage from falling. Gallus Domesticus . You can cast the polymorph spell on yourself with this trait, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. When you use this version of polymorph , you always assume the form of a Tiny chicken . Once you cast the spell, you can’t cast it again with this trait until you finish a long rest. Headless Chicken . When you are reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, you don’t immediately fall unconscious. Instead, you can immediately move up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. You then fall unconscious as if you had been reduced to 0 hit points in the space where you finish this movement.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Loot Tavern","book":"Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting - Compendium"},{"name":"Goblin","description":"Whether sniveling in fear, cackling with mad laughter, or snarling in a fury, goblins are wretched and inconsequential—at least in the eyes of most of Ravnica’s other folk. In their own minds, though, they are content to lurk in the shadows only until they fully come into their own and receive the recognition they believe they deserve. They are entitled to some credit for their tenacity, agility, crafty ingenuity, and dumb luck, all of which has enabled them to survive in a world overrun with creatures larger and more powerful than they are. Small and Wiry Standing around 3 feet tall and covered in warty green or red skin, goblins have huge noses and ears. Their wiry bodies are surprisingly strong, and their mouths are full of sharp, crooked teeth. Most goblins are bald, either by heredity or by choice, but a few boast shocks of red or black hair. Their arms and legs are elongated in proportion to their small bodies, and their fingers and toes are also long and slender. Many goblins prefer to go unshod to leave their toes exposed for climbing. Unfettered Emotion Creatures of raw impulse, goblins are found among guilds that value that quality, particularly the Izzet (where they typically serve as attendants for researchers), the Gruul (in camps that form hapless buffers between the clans and civilized regions), the Rakdos (putting their love of explosions to good use), and occasionally the Boros (if they discover a well of discipline and courage within themselves, or find themselves unable to resist the shininess of Boros weapons and armor). Many goblins are guildless and make their way as members of street gangs. Sometimes driven by wild mood swings, goblins have an inclination toward destruction, which can take a playful form but is often anything but. Some goblins clobber things, others like to light them on fire, and many love to blow things up. Goblins have an outrageous sense of humor, usually expressed through mischievous pranks. The malicious among them find pleasure in the misfortune of others and tend to cackle maniacally whenever they’re amused. They can act with apparent randomness, sometimes just to confuse and befuddle others. Goblin Names The Goblin language is fond of certain sounds, and goblin names tend to repeat those sounds to form what can sound like nonsense words. A goblin’s name gives no indication of gender.

Long before the god Mag­lubiyet conquered them, early goblins served in the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, one of the Feywild’s archfey. Goblins thrived in her dangerous domain thanks to a special boon from her—a supernatural knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble. Goblins brought this fey boon with them to worlds across the Material Plane, even if they don’t remember the fey realm they inhabited before Maglubiyet’s rise.

By my sword, I claim this place and name it Rhukaan Draal, the crown city of Darguun, the land of the people!” —Don Bassingthwaite, The Doom of Kings The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bug bears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands of years. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire. City Goblins Goblins dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War. The Ghaal’dar The Ghaal’dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal’dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bug bear peers. The history of the Ghaal’dar is filled with strife; when they weren’t fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal’dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal’dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun (see chapter 2). The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos. As a Ghaal’dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal’dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you’re seeking allies to reclaim your birthright. The Marguul The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the Ghaal’dar long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal’dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide. As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It’s certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you’ve taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally. The Heirs of Dhakaan Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds of corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire. The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal’dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they’ve dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani. The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don’t have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh’dar (“silent folk”), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh’dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin. As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani? Goblinoid Names Goblinoid names often feature drawn-out vowel sounds (represented by doubled letters), as seen in the names of both their ancient empire (Dhakaan) and their newborn country (Darguun). Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use the same names and naming conventions, despite their tribal differences.

It was at the moment she awoke—I ain’t never heard anything like it, and I might never again.” —Nilmuan Malrinn, dragonborn naval captain There is power in music. Choruses have thrummed through celestial realms since the first sounds echoed across the great vastness of space and existence. When a mortal is born with a divine song in their blood and a connection to an empyrean chorus, they are called a godsinger. Godsong scions are hymnal, drawn to where they can join their voice with others’ voices for a higher calling. They can be found among soldiers, adventurers, rebels, refugees—wherever their song can reach, empower, embolden, and aid others, that is where they lift their voices highest, heard above the thunder of tyranny and suffering. Thrumming Appearance Avatars of intangible power, godsingers bear manifestations of untouchable radiance as they sing. When they manifest, their wings are made of light, glistening currents of wind, or reverberating colors. Music notes, wafting glints of light, or visible tremors in the air surround them when their voice resounds. Their power is wholly apparent in their divine appearance, just as it is in their song. Joining the Chorus Godsingers are not soloists. Music has bound together communities, workers, clergy, sailors, and more throughout history, and godsong scions revel in the bonds created by workers’ songs, shanties, and hymns. While a godsinger may seek to find their individual song, their music is inherently communal—their holy calling is to be around people, to bolster others, to administer aid to those in need. Godsingers who use their songs only for glory, selfish recognition, or vapid or frivolous entertainment find that their inspiration and their connections to the songs that came before them rapidly wane. They forget songs they have known since birth and struggle to write arrangements or improvise ditties as they once did. They don’t lose their powers, but they lose their artistry . As their divine virtuosity dwindles, their Celestial progenitor reminds them that the most holy use of their voice is to uplift others as much as themselves, and returning to their calling opens the font of inspiration once more. Awakening the Song From birth, godsong scions display complex vocal aptitude—even their infant cries are melodious—and they innately know the choruses that Celestials have sung for millennia. But each godsinger also has an individual song, a melody imprinted in their very soul. Some know that song intrinsically, while others spend their lives searching for their divine hymn.When a godsong scion discovers their unique song, they achieve their awakening. An awakened godsinger feels connected with their divine origins, confident in their holy calling, and certain of themselves in the vast cosmos. They know they are the universe’s gentle, coaxing lullaby, its resounding rallying cry, or its sweet crooning on a warm summer’s eve. Most godsong scions awaken at a moment when they feel certain in their identity and purpose—the moment they realize, “This is who I am and why I’m here.” It is an empowering experience, one that many godsingers ache for as they join the choruses of scions before them. The Awakening GMs with unawakened godsong scions in their campaigns should work with their players to find a moment of awakening. Such a moment could occur in combat against a personal foe, when the character achieves a long-sought goal, when they finally meet their Celestial progenitor, or any other affirming, triumphant moment. Or, the godsigner may awaken during a quiet moment—perhaps, on the verge of breaking and despair, they hear a soft melody that reminds them who they are. At the GM’s discretion, a godsong scion’s awakening could provide temporary boosts to their traits. For example, Bolstering Hymn could gain a range of 60 feet instead of 30 feet for 7 days (or, if near the end of the campaign, until the end of the story). Boundless Voice could last an hour instead of 10 minutes. Tying even a small mechanical boon to the moment of awakening can greatly increase the impact of such a moment, creating catharsis and triumph. Godsinging and Adventuring Granted holy gifts of voice and song, and heir to the empowering songs of those who came before, godsong scions are naturally suited to roles of leadership, communication, and diplomacy, becoming battlefront paladins and inspiring bards. But many famous godsingers of legend found unconventional ways to adventure and lead others. The godsinger rogue Cora Elaina snuck into prison encampments and aided rebellions with her low, raspy songs of solidarity and hope. Owain Cogswright, the scion artificer whose warbling tenor voice echoed through his workshop and inspired a burst of innovation, is credited with advancing technology decades forward over the span of a few years. Heavenly Music A godsinger’s music can take any form—“hymnal” and “holy” singing does not necessitate a single style of music, a single genre, or a single atmosphere. Any style of music befits a godsong scion. Godsinging is and has always been united—a chorus for anyone to join, no matter who they are and what they love. When godsingers find their niche, beautiful and impossible things come of it. Godsong Scion Traits Your godsong scion has the following traits. Ability Score Increase Your Charisma score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Ability Scores While each scion ancestry provides suggested ability score increases, you are encouraged to increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and another by 1 if you wish, just as many fifth edition supplements now support. Age Godsong scions mature at the same rate as humans, but they can live up to 150 years. Alignment Like other scions, most godsingers are good. However, they can fall anywhere between the extremes of diligently lawful and rebelliously chaotic. Virtuoso You learn the guidance cantrip. In addition, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill. Boundless Voice As an unparalleled orator, you can use a bonus action to make your speech intelligible to any creature for 10 minutes. For the duration, creatures can magically understand you, regardless of the language you speak. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Bolstering Hymn You are a beacon of song—those around you bask in the light of your voice and your eternal hymn. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, emanating light and radiance to your allies and empowering them with your godsong. When you transform, friendly creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear you gain temporary hit points equal to your level.

They are as hard and unforgiving as the mountain stone, as cold and pitiless as its bitter, cold winds. If you approach them in strength, they might consider you worthy of an alliance. —Tordek, A Guide to the Peaks At the highest mountain peaks—far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl—dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship with one. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying. Driven Competitors Every day brings a new challenge to a goliath. Food, water, and shelter are rare in the uppermost mountain reaches. A single mistake can bring doom to an entire tribe, while an individual’s heroic effort can ensure the entire group’s survival. Goliaths thus place a premium on self-sufficiency and individual skill. They have a compulsion to keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills. This dedication to competition has a dark side. Goliaths are ferocious competitors, but above all else they are driven to outdo their past efforts. If a goliath slays a dragon, he or she might seek out a larger, more powerful wyrm to battle. Few goliath adventurers reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past accomplishments. Fair Play For goliaths, competition exists only when it is supported by a level playing field. Competition measures talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic items, money, or other elements that can tip the balance one way or the other. Goliaths happily rely on such benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an advantage can always be lost. A goliath who relies too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains. This trait manifests most strongly when goliaths interact with other folk. The relationship between peasants and nobles puzzles goliaths. If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place. Goliaths rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society’s structures or rules to maintain power. Survival of the Fittest Among goliaths, any adult who can’t contribute to the tribe is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can’t take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play. A permanently injured goliath is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe. Typically, such a goliath dies attempting to keep up, or the goliath slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate. In some ways, the goliath drive to outdo themselves feeds into the grim inevitability of their decline and death. A goliath would much rather die in battle, at the peak of strength and skill, than endure the slow decay of old age. Few folk have ever meet an elderly goliath, and even those goliaths who have left their people grapple with the urge to give up their lives as their physical skills decay. Because of their risk-taking, goliath tribes suffer from a chronic lack of the experience offered by long-term leaders. They hope for innate wisdom in their leadership, for they can rarely count on a wisdom grown with age. Goliath Names Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn’s mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. A birth name is up to three syllables long. Clan names are five syllables or more and end in a vowel. Birth names are rarely linked to gender. Goliaths see females and males as equal in all things, and they find societies with roles divided by gender to be puzzling or worthy of mockery. To a goliath, the person who is best at a job should be the one tasked with doing it. A goliath’s nickname is a description that can change on the whim of a chieftain or tribal elder. It refers to a notable deed, either a success or failure, committed by the goliath. Goliaths assign and use nicknames with their friends of other races, and change them to refer to an individual’s notable deeds. Goliaths present all three names when identifying themselves, in the order of birth name, nickname, and clan name. In casual conversation, they use their nickname.

Sure they left a generous helping of gold, but I wasn’t gonna till my garden for another week!“ - Pottleberry Tom, Garden Gnome Extraordinaire The rich scent of freshly-turned earth may be a sure indicator that a group of nomadic golynn (GO-lin) is in the area. Vivacious wanderers, golynn are creatures of nature and have little use for the trappings of modern society. Their shovel-like hands, scaly exterior, and insect-devouring constitution ensure their survival wherever the earth is soft and the soil is fertile. Hearth and Heartbeat Golynn adore rhythm. They find joy in the thrum of a lightning-rail, the clip-clop of a riding goat’s hooves, and the heartbeats of their kith and kin. From these everyday occurrences, golynn make wonderfully complex polyrhythms, music whose restorative vibrations can reinvigorate the melancholy and afraid. Indeed, the lead percussionist for the legendary opteran band, Wings of a Butterfly, was Hopo Aman, a golynn maestro of the dwarven tablah. Golynn legend tells of a single, pulsing rhythm that drives all life in the world, the golo’apa , or ‘Heartbeat of the World’. Many golynn’s nomadic existence is a singular quest to explore all the nooks and crannies of the world, searching for this rhythm. In their never-ending pilgrimage, golynn leave a plethora of hidden burrows—warm, safe spaces whose locations are passed on by word of mouth. Dig a Hole Lotta’ Trouble This constant burrowing can sometimes bring golynn into conflict with the uto monké , or ‘those that live under the sky’. Golynn have ruined many a quality murderbowl pitch and have even inadvertently undermined castles while searching for the rhythmic clanking of a prisoner’s chains. Conversely, some farmers, recognising their natural aptitude for digging, engage passing golynn as farmhands whenever possible, promising them all the grubs they can eat in exchange for a day’s work. Happenstance Not all golynn are raised by their own kin. Rumours of the magical healing properties of golynn scales still abound, leading unsavoury and desperate individuals to hunt them for these entirely-mundane components. Fortunately, orphaned golynn have been taken in by all manner of parents, from halflings, dwarves, and gnomes to lotol and kobolds, who regard them as huge, scaled, dragon-kin. With their fondness for exploration, golynn make natural adventurers. A burrowing golynn might accidentally fall into an underground sepulchre, find a long-buried artifact, or stumble upon the machinations of an evil necromancer bent on raising an army of the undead. Golynn Traits As a golynn, you have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1. Age . Golynn grow rapidly and reach maturity at 10 years of age. On average, they live about 150 years. Languages . You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Size . Golynn stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and average between 300 and 400 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet . Natural Armour. Your body is covered in thick, keratinous scales. When you aren’t wearing armour, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armour to determine your AC if the armour you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armour. Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Shovel Talons . Your wide, powerful claws are perfect for creating tunnels and burrows. You have a burrowing speed of 15 feet , but can only use it to tunnel through soft earth, or loose stone. Drill Dervish . While burrowing underground, you can shift the ground under a creature’s feet, potentially causing it to fall over. If you burrow directly under a Large or smaller creature that is standing on the ground, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone . The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. Tremorsense . Knowing where the next meal—like a juicy, giant earthworm—can be found while underground requires a specific adaptation. You have tremorsense out to a range of 5 feet . As an action, you can hone your senses, increasing the range of this sense out to 20 feet until the end of your next turn.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Loot Tavern","book":"Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting - Compendium"},{"name":"Grim","description":"Grims \"Though I’ve yet to meet a grim as old as myself, they are long lived. And in those long lives, they have seen much. Seldom have I spent a more pleasant evening than among the grims, sharing tall tales and listening to their delightful music. Their perspective is unusual for they see the world quite differently than those of us who live most of our lives on the surface. Yet, they can become restless and short-tempered, especially if reminded of all they believe they have lost. Respect those moments and leave them be; never overstay your welcome!\" —Otis the Historian The grims are children of Grimnir. Most are comfortable beneath murky lake waters in forests that no raider has ever found. Others were forced to flee their refuges, pushed out by raiders, Baendur, and monsters. The grim often form small communities that linger near, but not entirely within, existing raider towns. They fish, they mend nets, and, for coin or food, they might even sing in feast halls. Though many grims still lament the lives they have lost, the younger generation embraces the dynamic communities of the raiders. They long to spread their music to shores far and wide across all of Grimnir. Creatures of the Water All grims long for water—whether sea, river, or pool. It is comforting to them to be submerged and to stare up at the world around them, watching and observing from a distance. Grims breathe underwater through a primal magic that no mortal truly understands. Their ears are wide and pointed, and they tend to have green or blue skin to blend in with their murky habitats. Their eyes are often light yellow or green, and skin flaps on their arms and legs can extend, helping them swim. Of Two Natures Grims have conflicted souls. They originated with Grimnir when it was created and perhaps their internal conflict arises from the turmoil that surrounded that creation. Some grims live their entire lives indulging in their music—performing or teaching others how to play instruments, sing, and entertain. Others resent the encroachment of mortals into their pools and waterfalls and do what they can to deter trespassers. But it is never so simple. For within each grim is the capacity for both a deep love and appreciation of life as well as a cruel selfishness. As events in their lives unfold, they may change their very nature and walk many different paths.

Their good fortune seems an awful lot like cheating. Or maybe it’s their cheating that looks an awful lot like good fortune? —Victor, thief The grimalkin were once a people divided. There were grimalkin native to the Feywild and grimalkin native to the Shadowfell. The two sides were locked in a war which, for grimalkin, meant an endless parade of usually harmless, often elaborate, and occasionally cruel pranks. As the war dragged on from decades to millennia, denizens of the Shadowfell and the Feywild conspired with one another for a way to be rid of these nuisances for good. Eventually an agreement was struck and the grimalkin were driven from the Shadowfell and the Feywild and a curse was laid over their race that only so many could gather in each of those realms at a time. Although annoyed at having to endure the consequences of forced relocation, the grimalkin were quite pleased with the dramatic extent of the reaction their warring had elicited in others. Fancy Felines In appearance, grimalkin are nearly indistinguishable from a large, bipedal house cat. They usually stand slightly below 3 feet tall and weigh no more than 30 pounds and have a tail about a third again of their size in length. When they lived in other realms, their coats were more uniform but today, breeding between the two groups has caused any number of fur patterns to manifest. A grimalkin’s eyes are usually green, purple, or golden. Despite how easily they can pass themselves off as house cats, grimalkin rarely do so unless it’s part of a prank or gambit. When dealing with members of other races, grimalkin tend to wear an excessive amount of clothing and accessories, as if that were the proof necessary to show they are indeed a race of people and not an animal. Grimalkin fashion is considered garish and mismatched by most other races. Cat Caravans Grimalkin are widely mistrusted by other peoples and thus often live in their own itinerant communities. These communities can be as small as a couple of families in a few wagons to dozens of families in nearly a hundred wagons. Traveling from settlement to settlement, grimalkin take work as couriers, entertainers, and farmhands. They also make money grifting and practicing hedge magic. When the grimalkin were exiled from the Feywild and Shadowfell, they brought with them the many strange customs they had developed in those alien places. Although they came together as one people, they had two distinct cultures based on their prior plane of origin. After a few generations, these customs mingled and now would seem out of place even if they were to return to their distant homes. Most of these idiosyncratic customs are based around death or self-expression. For example, during card games, they always deal a hand for the most recently deceased mutual acquaintance they all share and they believe it is bad luck to dance and play a musical instrument simultaneously. Curiouser and Curiouser The grimalkin have a legend that a particularly clever member of their own kind will one day discover a way to lift the curse limiting the number of their kind that can enter the Feywild and Shadowfell. This legend inspires some grimalkin to split away from their caravans to search for sources of magical power or curry favors from powerful wizards or interplanar beings. Grimalkin are a curious people as a rule. They travel the world in caravans with their families, but occasionally find something in the world that captures their attention and decide that they can’t leave it until they’ve discovered everything there is to know about it. Some grimalkin may even inadvertently become adventurers as they wander too far from their traveling caravans and never find their way back again. Grimalkin Names A grimalkin’s name consists of as many as four parts, depending on their parentage and family history. Those grimalkin with ancestors from the Feywild use their personal name, their mother’s personal name, their father’s personal name, and “...of the Shine.” Grimalkin with ancestors from the Shadowfell use their personal name, their father’s personal name, their mother’s personal name, and “...of the Gloom.” Grimalkin who do not know their parents do not include their parent’s personal names as part of their full name but may still choose to associate themselves with a historical conclave of grimalkin if they wish. There is a movement among younger grimalkin to abandon references to the old war altogether and drop both epithets from their names. Female Names: Blythe, Cady, Corliss, Demelza, Godiva, Idina, Matilda, Nara, Radella, Rowena, Sabella, Zelda. Male Names: Alder, Arundel, Beldon, Colbert, Dayton, Digby, Erskine, Kenelm, Methra, Nedes, Oswin, Seabert, Tostig. Grimalkin Traits Your grimalkin character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma scores increase by 1. Age. Grimalkin are considered adults at age 6, elders by age 28, and rarely live past 50 years of age. Alignment. Grimalkin are fiercely independent and willful. They are almost always chaotic. Grimalkin tend to be self-serving but not to the extent that they are cruel. Most are neutral. Size. Grimalkin are usually just shy of 3 feet tall and weigh about 30 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25. Catlike. You have advantage on ability checks made to trick others into believing you are just a house cat. Claws. Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Darkvision. Accustomed to the perpetually twilit forests of the Feywild or the lightless skies of the Shadowfell, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Mischievous Talent. You gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Deception, Insight, Perception, or Stealth. Steal Fortune. When a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to give that roll disadvantage. When you do, one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw of your choice that you make within the next minute gains advantage. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common. To others, the grimalkin dialect of Common sounds all the same, but to a grimalkin, the Feywild and Shadowfell dialects are almost completely separate languages.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Sterling Vermin Adventuring Co.","book":"The Ultimate Adventurer's Handbook"},{"name":"Hadozee","description":"Hadozees' progenitors were mammals no bigger than housecats. Hunted by larger natural predators, they took to the trees and evolved wing-like flaps that enabled them to glide from branch to branch. Today, hadozees are sapient, bipedal beings eager to leave behind the fearsome predators of their homeworld and explore other worlds. In addition to being natural climbers, hadozees have feet that are as dexterous as their hands, even to the extent of having opposable thumbs. Membranes of skin hang loosely from their arms and legs. When stretched taut, these membranes enable hadozees to glide. Hadozees wrap these wings around themselves to keep warm. Hadozee Traits As a hadozee player character, you have the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Dexterous Feet. As a bonus action, you can use your feet to manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, or pick up or set down a Tiny object. Glide. When you fall at least 10 feet above the ground, you can use your reaction to extend your skin membranes to glide horizontally a number of feet equal to your walking speed, and you take 0 damage from the fall. You determine the direction of the glide. Hadozee Dodge. The magic that runs in your veins heightens your natural defenses. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. Add your proficiency bonus to the number rolled, and reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to that total (minimum of 0 damage). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":16643},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Spelljammer - Adventures in Space"},{"name":"Half Aquatic Elf","description":"An elf who looks upon a half-elf sees a human, and a human who beholds the same person sees an elf. Though this characterization is simplistic, it gets to the heart of what it means to be a half-elf in Faerûn. To elves who have an extreme viewpoint on the matter, half-elves are emblematic of the decline of elven civilization, a dilution of the race’s heritage and culture that will lead to its eventual dissolution. To the humans at the other end of the spectrum, half-elves have an unfair advantage over their fully human peers, and are seen as privileged or favored regardless of the actual circumstances of their birth. For most folk in Faerûn, the issue isn’t so cut and dried. Half-elves are generally tolerated wherever they go, or wherever they take up residence—with the proviso that a society that doesn’t look kindly on elves or humans is likely to feel the same way about someone who has the blood of both races. Conversely, a society that holds humans or elves in high esteem doesn’t usually bestow the same status on half-elves (though such individuals are generally not ostracized). Young Race, Old Roots In the distant past, half-elves were scarce because humans and elves came into contact only infrequently. The ancient elven kingdoms of Cormanthyr and Myth Drannor had significant populations of half-elves. It is only in the past thousand years or so, as the races have intermingled more and more, that the number of half-elves has increased so that they are now found throughout Faerûn. Not surprisingly, half-elves enjoy the company of others of their kind, such that where half-elves congregate, they are likely to be joined by others. Most of the half-elves in the North and along the Sword Coast are of moon elf heritage mixed with Illuskan or Tethyrian blood. In other parts of Faerûn, half-elves have significant communities in the Yuirwood and throughout Aglarond. Aquatic half-elves are found along the coasts, including near Aglarond, the Dragon Coast, Impiltur, Sembia, and the Vilhon Reach. Drow half-elves are most numerous in the nation of Dambrath, which was conquered by the dark elves years ago, and in the Underdark, where House Ousstyl of Menzoberranzan is particularly infamous for having mated with humans. Mixed Heritage Half-elves are a diverse lot, given the number of combinations of elf subraces and human ethnicities in their ranks. Most of them consider their dual nature a blessing more than a disadvantage, because it gives them a set of capabilities and a perspective on the world that full-blooded humans and elves can’t hope to match. At the same time, the mixed heritage of half-elves dictates that they make an effort to fit in with humans or elves when possible. For instance, half-elves born and raised in human settlements tend to have human names, while half-elves in elven communities generally have elven names.

Dwarven culture is conservative and implicitly forbids relationships between dwarves and other races, so most half-dwarves are born in times of social upheaval or as the result of a secret romance. Half-dwarves raised among dwarves are social pariahs, seen by their community as a living embodiment of the consequences of breaking with tradition.

To dwarves, half-dwarves look like humans. Half-dwarves stand between 4 and a half to 5 and a half feet tall and weigh around 200 pounds. They aren’t as stocky as dwarves but have a broader stature and more muscular physique than humans. Half-dwarves exhibit a range of skin tones and hair colors, but have notably thick and full hair. Half-dwarves have experimental senses of fashion, taking dwarven and human traditions and blending them. Novel hairstyles and colors, or ways of wearing facial hair and jewelry are things that half-dwarves do to create their own identity. These styles are rarely subdued and cause half-dwarves to stand out in a crowd. Iconoclasts and Innovators Routinely reminded by humans and dwarves alike that they have no unique culture of their own, half-dwarves are often rebels and revolutionaries. This manifests in a variety of ways, from forsaking the local religious customs, to experimenting in new forms of art, to advocating for vast and dramatic political changes. If proponents of the status quo suggest they shouldn’t even exist, half-dwarves have no reason to embrace the cultural institutions that stand against them. This tendency to align against tradition means half-dwarves often participate in countercultural movements and befriend other social misfits. Half-Dwarf Names Half-dwarves tend to use either human or dwarf names. Those raised in human communities are usually given dwarven names and those raised in dwarven communities usually given human names. Half-Dwarf Traits Your half-dwarf has some of the natural fortitude and traits dwarves possess but also shares qualities with other half-dwarves that set them apart from their stockier kin. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one ability score of your choice increases by 1. Age. Half-dwarves mature at the same rate as humans reaching adulthood around their second decade of life. They tend to live to around 200 years old. Alignment. Half-dwarves can be of any alignment. Half-dwarves raised in dwarven communities tend to be chaotic as they are perceived as outsiders and identify closely with defying social customs and expectations. Size. Half-dwarves are slightly smaller than humans, ranging from four and a half to five and a half feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to your dwarf heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Tireless. When you finish a short rest, you can choose to lose up to one of your levels of exhaustion and regain half your maximum hit points. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. Tool Proficiency. You gain proficiency with a tool set of your choice. Half-dwarves have all the raw talent of their dwarven kin without being bound by tradition to apply it to only a handful of endeavors. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Half-dwarves speak common and other languages without the harsh accent of the dwarves. Muls? On some worlds half-dwarves are more commonly known as muls, an epithet which is believed to have been derived from the dwarven word for “strength”, mul-zhennedar. The word mul can be pronounced MULL or MOOL but is sometimes pronounced in an intentionally inflammatory fashion as MULE.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Sterling Vermin Adventuring Co.","book":"The Ultimate Adventurer's Handbook"},{"name":"Half-dwarves - Mezzi-Nani","description":"Early in history dwarves have mated with humans and thus the species of half-dwarves was born. Unlike pure dwarves, half-dwarves do not shun human company, but actively seek it out instead. Many are proud artisans who have created beautiful works of art or contributed to famous cathedrals, like Nanni di Banco “Il nano Nanni” (1373–1421), who worked on the facade of the duomo in Florence. Others are prosperous merchants or even scholars, but most prefer a more active lifestyle and like to work with their hands. Although they are involved in human society, they try to avoid politics, which they find annoying and pointless. Mezzi-nani have been crucial for maintaining contact between pure dwarves and the human world. They act as go-betweens and see to it that the more seclusive clans in their underground places are always up-to-date with the newest technical advancements and all important developments in the “outer” world. Half-dwarves are in some way the best possible combination of species: They do have the resilience and reliability of dwarves, but do not share their inherent mistrust of others. Despite their longevity, they are much quicker to adapt to new situations and eager to learn and develop. They are self-confident and not easily distracted and quite realistic when it comes to assessing situations. This makes them successful in almost anything they attempt. Half-dwarves are family people and will usually stay close to their clans, live in the same neighborhood, share all important life events and in general be very protective towards all kin. In this, they are basically like the average Italian human. But what makes them really different is the high status that female half-dwarves hold. In contrast to their human counterparts, they will usually learn and work in a profession, and will not permit anyone to restrict their rights to do so. This is were they will clash with the refined Renaissance view of women. They will, however, usually make up for it with their positive outlook and wealth. By the way: The singular masculine and feminine forms of mezzi-nani are mezzo-nano and mezza-nana. Half-Dwarves – Mezzi-Nani Traits Appearance. They do not stand out much in human society. They are rather stocky and muscular, but this does not make them ridiculous in any way. Imagine a short wrestler. Half-dwarves are usually dressed with care and appropriate to their standing. Younger half-dwarves sometimes tend towards extravagance while the elders will appear more conservative. Half-dwarves will have the most amazing wavy or curly hair, and females in particular will carry it with pride and in elaborate styles. They can be incredibly attractive. Ability score increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1, as does your Wisdom. Age. Half-dwarves mature at the same speed as humans, but will live quite a bit longer, up to 200 years. After the age of 100, they will often quit human society and go live with their dwarf relatives. Alignment. If you use alignments, half-dwarves will usually be lawful and either good or neutral, but it is of course up to you. If you choose to be chaotic evil, please create a good background story to explain why. Size. Although they seldom stand taller than 5 feet (1,6 meters), half-dwarves will never be as short as some pure dwarves. Your size is medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Special dwarven skills. You share the dwarven skills darkvision (although restricted to 30 feet), tool proficiency and stonecunning. Self-confidence. You are not easily intimidated or charmed. You get a +2 in any situation that requires a saving throw against such attempts, even spells. Languages. You speak the language of the country you live in as well as the regional dwarfish dialect. Religion. Mezzi-nani will most likely adhere to the human faith of their home country, or more rarely share the beliefs of the pure dwarves. The more recent interpretation of God as a builder and the Renaissance idea of active mortals fits their inherent disposition. In later times, half-dwarves will become crucial in the rise of Freemasonry as well as the Protestant faiths. Odd facts. Female half-dwarves often give birth to twins or triplets and most of their children survive due to their strong constitutions and decent living conditions. This is why half-dwarves are the most numerous of all non-human species. In Florence, they make up more than 1% of the population, without drawing any attention. This is somehow odd, in particular when taking into consideration that they do not hide their affiliation. When asked, they will call themselves half-dwarves or sometimes half-men. But this information will mostly be brushed off as a joke. Humans usually only acknowledge facts they want to find credible!","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Vortex Verlag","book":"The Straight Way Lost"},{"name":"Half-Elf","description":"These D&D 5E Free Basic Rules only contain a fraction of the races, subclasses, backgrounds, feats, items, monsters, spells, and other content available on Roll20.

He thought he saw the figure of a man striding up the path. Standing, Flint drew back into the shadow⁠ of a tall pine to see better. The man’s walk was marked by an easy grace—an elvish⁠ grace, Flint would have said; yet the man’s body had the thickness and tight muscles of a human, while the facial hair was definitely humankind’s. All the dwarf could see of the man’s face beneath a green hood was tan skin and a brownish-red beard. A longbow⁠ was slung over one shoulder and a sword hung at his left side. He was dressed in soft leather, carefully tooled in the intricate designs the elves loved. But no elf in the world of Krynn could grow a beard . . . no elf, but . . . “Tanis?” said Flint hesitantly as the man neared. “The same.” The newcomer’s bearded face split in a wide grin. He held open his arms and, before the dwarf could stop him, engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted him off the ground. The dwarf clasped his old friend close for a brief instant, then, remembering his dignity, squirmed and freed himself from the half-elf’s embrace. —Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, Dragons of Autumn Twilight Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined sen⁠ses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood⁠ in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life. Of Two Worlds To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they’re on par with both parents, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents. Diplomats or Wanderers Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds. In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers. Half-Elf Names Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among elves often take human names.

It is said that the humanist Pope Pius II (Enea Silvio Piccolomini) was a half-elf and instructed his family in the ancient history of this species. Pius founded the city of Pienza as a secret refuge for all elves and half-elves who felt rejected or threatened by human society. Please read the introduction (chapter 1) and the text about elves to understand the dilemma of half-elves: Contrary to mere humans, they know that the other species are very real and have a strong emotional connection to them, but they also feel the need to be part of the human society that has distanced itself from all non-humans.

He usually rose before most of his warriors, since he had a strong streak of human blood in him, and he found the daylight⁠ less bothersome than most of his tribe did. Among the Bloody Skulls, a warrior was judged by his stren⁠gth, his fierceness, and his wits. Human⁠ ancestry was no blemish against a warrior—provided he was every bit as strong, enduring, and bloodthirsty as his full-blooded kin. Half-orcs⁠ who were weaker than their orc comrades didn’t last long among the Bloody Skulls or any other orc tribe for that matter. But it was often true that a bit of human blood gave a warrior just the right mix of cunning, ambition, and self-discipline to go far indeed, as Mhurren had. He was master of a tribe that could muster two thousand spears, and the strongest chief in Thar. —Richard Baker, Swordmage Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock⁠ or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict⁠, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs⁠ rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury. Scarred and Strong Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs⁠ stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds. Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans might display these scars proudly or hide them in shame. The Mark of Gruumsh The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship can’t fully escape his influence. The same is true of half-orcs, though their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs⁠ hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh’s exultation when they join in melee combat—and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs⁠ are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it. Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn’t just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures—feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing—fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs⁠ are those with enough self-control to get by in a civilized land. Tribes and Slums Half-orcs most often live among orcs. Of the other races, humans are most likely to accept half-orcs⁠, and half-orcs⁠ almost always live in human lands when not living among orc tribes. Whether proving themselves among rough barbarian⁠ tribes or scrabbling to survive in the slums of larger cities, half-orcs⁠ get by on their physical might, their endurance, and the sheer determination they inherit from their human ancestry. Half-Orc Names Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture in which they were raised. A half-orc⁠ who wants to fit in among humans might trade an orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs⁠ with human names decide to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more intimidating. Male Orc Names: Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, Keth, Krusk, Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk Female Orc Names: Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif, Myev, Neega, Ovak, Ownka, Shautha, Sutha, Vola, Volen, Yevelda Half-Orc Traits Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc ancestry.

Grudging Acceptance Each half-orc finds a way to gain acceptance from those who hate orcs. Some are reserved, trying not to draw attention to themselves.

Small and Practical The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the sha⁠dow of empires and on the edges of wars. Halflings like to wear practical clothes, favoring bright colors. Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering. Kind and Curious Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing. Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer.

Salvatore, The Crystal⁠ Shard The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver. Small and Practical The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the sha⁠dow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds. Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors. Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering. Kind and Curious Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing. Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times. Blend into the Crowd Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth⁠ and their unassuming nature helps halflings⁠ to avoid unwanted attention. Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened. Pastoral Pleasantries Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires. Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home. Exploring Opportunities Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a necessity. Halfling Names A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through the generations. Male Names: Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby Female Names: Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna Family Names: Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, Tosscobble, Underbough Affable and Positive Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to make sweeping generalizations—especially negative ones. Dwarves. “Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count on them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile once in a while?” Elves. “They’re so beautiful! Their faces, their music, their grace and all. It’s like they stepped out of a wonderful dream. But there’s no telling what’s going on behind their smiling faces—surely more than they ever let on.” Humans. “Humans are a lot like us, really. At least some of them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to the farmers and herders and you’ll find good, solid folk. Not that there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers—you have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their own lands, they protect us as well.” Halfling Traits Your halfling character has a number of traits in common⁠ with all other halflings. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. A halfling reaches adulthood⁠ at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century. Size.

You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings⁠ are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings⁠ speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling. Subrace.

They call themselves the Dunni, or “the people” in their own tongue. They share the same range of skin and hair color as the elves, but their ears are less pointed and their brown or green eyes are not as large and penetrating. Where still free-living, the nomadic tribes dwell on the open plains in large hide tents they share with their extended families. The farming families have almost been wiped out by the advance of the Shadow, but a few groups still remain along the southeastern margins of Erethor. They dwell in cozy sod villages and keep themselves alive through their exceptional horticultural skills and the watchful presence of their wogren companions. Whether farmers or nomads, halflings wear durable clothes of boro leather and fine, intricately woven wool. They keep their hair long and done up in complex braids that indicate their family and community. Sadly, most halflings now live in slavery, captured and forced to work in the occupied cities or military camps of Izrador’s armies. The free-living halflings feed on their livestock and crops, while the enthralled survive off what scraps they can scrounge, beg, or steal. The halfling weapon of choice is the spear, with which they protect their flocks, hunt wild boar, and skewer the occasional orc.

They resemble hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures. Despite their sturdiness, hedges are sensitive and emotional creatures, who display meekness more than bravado. Their meek demeanor and deference in social situations has earned them a reputation as cowards in the eyes of outsiders. But rather than being born of cowardice, their behavior stems from a desire to respect the feelings and sensitivities of others, something considered to be of utmost importance in hedge society. Sensitive and Kind Hedges have an incredible capacity for empathy, and tend to view all creatures, from the smallest beetle to the largest beast, as being equally deserving of respect and dignity. They are known across the Wood for being excellent conflict mediators, and usually find themselves acting as diplomats or emissaries between factions trying to broker an agreement. Hedges feel most at home when everyone gets along. They are one of the few races who truly understand that conflict is not an evil force but simply represents an imbalance which must be resolved. This is not to say that hedges have never known strife, only that their proactive approach to mediation, coupled with their deep respect for the dignity of all living creatures, results in fewer occasions for conflict. Yet, when a serious conflict does arise, hedges who feel they have been truly and deeply wronged can close themselves off from the rest of their society, sometimes resulting in splits in a community. One of the reasons hedges display such deep empathy and compassion towards others is due to the intensity of the emotions they feel. The strength of these emotions applies as much to positive feelings it does negative, meaning emotional wounds run deep with hedges. One With the Forest Gifted with a unique connection to the Great Rhythm, hedges are tied into the natural world in a fashion similar to the connection possessed by some gallus. This has granted hedges special magical gifts, such as the ability to speak with the smallest ground-dwelling creatures in the Wood, and the power to cause flowers to bloom. It is quite common for hedges to have a variety of animal friends who share their home. Hedges who dwell outside of the birdfolk cities prefer to live in individual burrows under the great roots of trees. Communities of hedges enjoy living surrounded by nature, near clearings within the forest or lone copses. Central meeting areas and communal gardens can be constructed in the spaces between burrows. Hedges love gardening, and tend to keep a few small gardens wherever they live. Dressed for Comfort Hedges need special consideration when wearing clothes, and favor loose tunics, baggy trousers, flowing robes, and other clothes which fit easily over their quills. When not actively flared out, these tough quills naturally flatten, becoming smooth to the touch. However, if suddenly frightened, their quills reflexively flare out and stiffen, an accident which can ruin a hedge’s clothing. Adventuring clothes made specifically for hedges are available in nearly every major city in Humblewood, and tailors throughout the Wood are familiar with making alterations to suit a hedge’s needs. Hedge Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Hedges take longer to mature than most other races, reaching adulthood around 20 years. They also live for a long time, with many reaching 120 years or more. Alignment. Hedges are compassionate, empathetic, and diplomatic, tending towards good alignments. They also favor neutral alignments, as hedges have a great respect for the balance of nature. Size. Hedges have short, rounded body shapes, standing between 3 and 4 feet in height, and weighing between 40 and 70 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Natural Burrowers. You have a burrowing speed of 15 feet. You are capable of burrowing through soil, but are unable to dig through anything more substantial with just your clawed hands. Spiny Quills. The backs of hedges are covered with spiny quills, which makes it impossible for hedges to wear armor. These quills provide exceptional protection, therefore you have a base armor class of 14 + your Dexterity modifier. Even though you can’t wear armor, you can still benefit from the armor class bonus provided by shields so long as you are proficient with them. Curl Up. You can use your action to curl up, exposing attackers to a wall of your toughened quills. While curled up you cannot move, attack, or cast spells with somatic components, and your base armor class becomes 19. You cannot benefit from any Dexterity bonus to armor class while curled up, but you can still use shields. Any creature that misses you with a melee attack while you are curled up takes 2d4 points of piercing damage from your sharp quills. If a creature hits you while you are curled up, you are knocked prone in your space at the end of the turn. You may uncurl yourself at any point during your turn. Forest Magic. You have a deep connection to the magic of the Wood. You know the druidcraft cantrip. Additionally, you can cast animal messenger as a 2nd level spell once with this trait, and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Speak With Bugs. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with creatures of the beast subtype that represent insects, spiders, worms, and other creepy crawlies, regardless of their size. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk and Hedge.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Hit Point Press","book":"Humblewood"},{"name":"Heru","description":"Ravenfolk, called heru in the Southlands, are valued and honored citizens in most realms.

Where wishing fails, ancient magic can offer a heart’s desire—at least, for a time. Hexbloods are individuals infused with eldritch magic, fey energy, or mysterious witchcraft. Some who enter into bargains with hags gain their deepest wishes but eventually find themselves transformed. These changes evidence a hag’s influence: ears that split in forked points, skin in lurid shades, long hair that regrows if cut, and an irremovable living crown. Along with these marks, hexbloods manifest hag-like traits, such as darkvision and a variety of magical methods to beguile the senses and avoid the same. While many hexbloods gain their lineage after making a deal with a hag, others reveal their nature as they age—particularly if a hag influenced them early in life or even before their birth. Many hexbloods turn to lives of adventure, seeking to discover the mysteries of their magic, to forge a connection with their fey natures, or to avoid a hag that obsesses over them. Heir of Hags One way hags create more of their kind is through the creation of hexbloods. Every hexblood exhibits features suggestive of the hag whose magic inspires their powers. This includes an unusual crown, often called an eldercross or a witch’s turn. This living, garland-like part of a hexblood’s body extends from their temples and wraps behind the head, serving as a visible mark of the bargain between hag and hexblood, a debt owed, or a change to come. Hexblood Origins A bargain with a hag or other eerie forces transformed your character into a magical being. Roll on or choose an option from the Hexblood Origins table to determine how your character gained their lineage. Hexblood Origins d6 Origin 1 Seeking a child, your parent made a bargain with a hag. You are the result of that arrangement. 2 Fey kidnappers swapped you and your parents’ child. 3 A coven of hags lost one of its members. You were created to replace the lost hag. 4 You were cursed as a child. A deal with the spirits of the forest transformed you into a hexblood, now free of the curse. 5 You began life as a fey creature, but an accident changed you and forced you from your home. 6 A slighted druid transformed you and bound you to live only so long as a sacred tree bears fruit. Hexbloods in the Domains of Dread When creating a hexblood, consult with your DM to see if it’s appropriate to tie your origins to one of the following Domains of Dread (detailed in chapter 3): Hazlan. The bizarre magic of this crumbling domain exposes the populace to supernatural forces, occasionally giving rise to hexbloods. Kartakass. Whimsical witches make their homes in the forests of Kartakass. They eagerly grant the wishes of locals seeking grand fortunes for their children. Tepest. Many of the children in the town of Viktal are hexbloods who exhibit their supernatural natures from a young age. Each youngster is considered a gift from the town’s patron deity, who is known as Mother. Hexblood Traits You have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Fey. Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Ancestral Legacy. If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it. If you don’t keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray. Eerie Token. As a bonus action, you can harmlessly remove a lock of your hair, one of your nails, or one of your teeth. This token is imbued with magic until you finish a long rest. While the token is imbued in this way, you can take these actions: Telepathic Message. As an action, you can send a telepathic message to the creature holding or carrying the token, as long as you are within 10 miles of it. The message can contain up to twenty-five words. Remote Viewing. If you are within 10 miles of the token, you can enter a trance as an action. The trance lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or are incapacitated. During this trance, you can see and hear from the token as if you were located where it is. While you are using your senses at the token’s location, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings. When the trance ends, the token is harmlessly destroyed. Once you create a token using this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, at which point your missing part regrows. Hex Magic. You can cast the disguise self and hex spells with this trait. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose the ability when you gain this lineage). A Hexblood created by a Night Hag Becoming a Hag Hags can undertake a ritual to irreversibly transform a hexblood they created into a new hag, either one of their own kind or that embodies the hexblood’s nature. This requires that both the hag and hexblood be in the same place and consent to the lengthy ritual—circumstances most hexbloods shun but might come to accept over the course of centuries. Once a hexblood undergoes this irreversible ritual, they emerge as a hag NPC no longer under the control of the hexblood’s player, unless the DM rules otherwise.

Many of them were driven from the Feywild by the conquering god Maglubiyet, who marshaled them as soldiers, but the fey realm left its mark; wherever they are in the multiverse, they continue to channel an aspect of the Feywild’s rule of reciprocity, which creates a mystical bond between the giver and the receiver of a gift. On some worlds, such bonds lead hobgoblins to form communities with deep ties to one another. In Eberron and the Forgotten Realms, vast hobgoblin legions have emerged, with ranks of devoted soldiers famed for their unity. Hobgoblins are generally taller than their goblin cousins but not quite as big as bugbears. They have curved, pointed ears and noses that turn bright red or blue during displays of emotion. Hobgoblin Traits As a hobgoblin, you have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a goblinoid for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a goblinoid. Size. You are Medium. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray. Fey Ancestry.

By my sword, I claim this place and name it Rhukaan Draal, the crown city of Darguun, the land of the people!” —Don Bassingthwaite, The Doom of Kings The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bug bears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands of years. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire. City Goblins Goblins dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War. The Ghaal’dar The Ghaal’dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal’dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bug bear peers. The history of the Ghaal’dar is filled with strife; when they weren’t fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal’dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal’dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun (see chapter 2). The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos. As a Ghaal’dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal’dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you’re seeking allies to reclaim your birthright. The Marguul The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the Ghaal’dar long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal’dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide. As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It’s certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you’ve taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally. The Heirs of Dhakaan Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds of corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire. The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal’dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they’ve dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani. The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don’t have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh’dar (“silent folk”), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh’dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin. As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani? Goblinoid Names Goblinoid names often feature drawn-out vowel sounds (represented by doubled letters), as seen in the names of both their ancient empire (Dhakaan) and their newborn country (Darguun). Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use the same names and naming conventions, despite their tribal differences.

Along with their more common variants, such as sylvans, gifted, and morgants, humans are also supposedly the only self-aware species in the known world, while the others all have magical and supernatural (or subnatural, unnatural, preternatural, or paranatural) origins. Or so they think, but beings such as pantegans, mandrakes, and wolf-cats totally disagree. One way or another, humans represent nine out of ten people you are likely to meet in the Kingdom. They’re the salt of the earth and the cannon fodder of all wars, the village people and mercenaries, those “who harvest cotton, rice, and wheat, and plant spelt all over the plateau”, as a famous Zigane song goes.

Surnames and Assorted Titles: name of the father or mother; name of the city of origin; name of the family trade; byname or epithet derived from someone’s characteristic traits. How Other Races See Them Being the most common race in the Kingdom, humans are seen as touchstones for all other races. Some marionettes and nonexistents go to great lengths to get the turquoises (aka blue fairies) to make them human, just as sylvans, malebranche, and gifted often go out of their way to mix with mankind. On the other hand, many identify humans as “common people” for this very reason: compared to the more whimsical species and natures, they are seen as banal and uninteresting individuals. Here, too, the truth lies in the middle: like all other races, humans are as dull or as brilliant as they choose to be. Human Traits Ability Score Increase.

Yet there was an energy, a love of adventure, that sang from every page. Long into the night Liriel read, lighting candle⁠ after precious candle⁠. She’d never given much thought to humans, but these stories fascinated her. In these yellowed pages were tales of bold heroes, strange and fierce animals, mighty primitive gods, and a magic that was part and fabric of that distant land. —Elaine Cunningham, Daughter of the Drow⁠ In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common⁠ races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds. A Broad Spectrum With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common⁠ races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood⁠ in their late teens and rarely live even a single century. Variety in All Things Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common⁠ races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics. Everyone’s Second-Best Friends Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle with members of other races. They get along with almost everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and functionaries of all kinds. Dwarves. “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.” Elves. “It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They don’t like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered with arrows⁠. Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot from them.” Halflings. “It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling—good food and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If halflings⁠ had a shred of ambition, they might really amount to something.” Lasting Institutions Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special⁠ location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling⁠ elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death’s clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone. Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands. Exemplars of Ambition Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion⁠ causes rather than territories or groups. Human Names and Ethnicities Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their region’s culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors. The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics⁠, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration and features. In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are found in more localized areas of Faerûn. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which world your human is in. Calishite Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes. They’re found primarily in southwest Faerûn.

Their hair ranges from black to dark brown, but in the lands where the Mulan are most prominent, nobles and many other Mulan shave off all their hair.

Their power breeds fear, which causes them to turn upon their own kind so quickly. Such was the fate of my own people. I would not wish to see it repeated. If this species were to realize its true greatness, they are sure to bring great change to our galaxy, whether it be toward an eternal utopia or total destruction. ” — Sualia, belare trader Though humans are not the newest nor even the youngest race to join the Sorium Accord, many of the council races view them as unenlightened. This misconception is mostly due to the tendency of humans to explore, investigate, discover, and confront anything and everything they come across. The drive to learn and adapt is what makes them so versatile, and a formidable ally to any world. The Grand Discovery As one of the many prominent races of the Silrayne Arc, it will soon be close to two centuries since human space exploration would uncover the existence of a Crucible hidden at the edge of their solar system. The discovery of sorium would propel human advancement, though Earth’s nations and societies fell into war over control of the Crucible and its renewable resource. Years of conflict ended when the belare, a spacefaring race from the Silrayne Arc, detected the activation of the Crucible and arrived at the Sol System. Not long afterward, humans were inducted into the Sorium Accord, a system of cooperation between the peoples of neighboring galaxies to network and distribute the use of sorium for purposes of development and travel. Today, humans aren’t much different physically than they were before joining the Accord, retaining their vast array of characteristics. Their ability to constantly adapt to their surroundings has allowed them to expand faster than most other species. Scorched Earth A decade before the arrival of the belare, the truce between Earth’s nations crumbled and the battle for control over sorium caused irreparable damage to many of the planet’s regions. Most of the Earth’s ecosystems are now held together by machines generating artificial climates, while other areas have become wastelands. Many humans had evolved to adapt to these harsh environments, known as “Seethes,” constantly striving to heal their once beautiful home. The X-Mark Conflict The clash between Earth’s nations erupted into a conflict that would have eventually destroyed their planet if the belare had not arrived. To this day, it is a mystery on all sides what caused the truce to crumble. A growing theory, however, is that groups of space colonists manipulated the nations into turning against each other. These colonists eventually seceded from humankind to become the prometheans of today. Uncontrollably Versatile Though humans have been adopted into the Sorium Accord, the old grudges they carry between their own people had evolved into contention between themselves and other races during the first few years. The existence of the prometheans underscores the way humans are viewed by other races as a stubborn, unenlightened people. However, their wide variety of customs, manners and opinions, coupled with an undying persistence, make humans a force to be reckoned with. The Ideal Patrons Over the past few generations, humans have expanded throughout the known galaxy, both discovering and inventing new cultures. They have eagerly become a part of an ever-changing, fluid society. Thus, many humans of today are no longer limited to their internal views and differences. Though still viewed as somewhat unenlightened, their bold, impulsive, and even rather reckless natures have garnered respect in the eyes of the other races. The human tendency to uphold their beliefs and convictions also gives them the ability to form close alliances and ties with others. Human Names With the multitude of different cultures and ethnicities carried from Sol into the rest of the galaxy, human names and surnames have not changed much over the past few generations. They are most often variants or adaptations of names passed on through family, region, or cultural tradition. Human Traits As a human, you possess the following traits. Age.

Now, the conquest of Izrador has left them a broken and divided people, increasingly suspicious and base. In once-great cities, they live as a people subjugated by the minions of the Shadow, and in the wilderness, they live a brutal and wretched existence. Most live in daily fear for their lives and those of their families. More isolated settlements drive off strangers or kill them outright, as long as they think they can get away with it. Towns and cities are lorded over by human puppet rulers who conspire with the terrible orc warlords and the preening legates who back their authority. Every settlement pays tribute to the armies of the Shadow in food, supplies, and slaves, and citizens live in mortal dread of having Izrador’s soldiers garrisoned in their town. But humans were not always the weak and hopeless beings they are today; they once prided themselves on their noble ancestry, drawn from the Great Houses of the Dorns and the aristocracy of the Sarcosan Empire. The descendants of these lineages have mingled to create a diverse, adaptable, and quick-witted people. This new people, the Erenlanders, are above all survivors. While many have bowed to the Shadow and let go of their proud pasts, some have risen up to fight for something even more important: their futures.

It is only when he makes himself stand out through kindness and bravery.” - Josef Rodson, Human Blacksmith Humans are the most commonly seen race in Ne’Oor, but because they hail from all over the Mainland, they are vastly different from each other in many ways, including their appearance, hairstyles, style of dress, and customs. These are passed down by way of culture and community, rather than just by genetic traits. Wardling humans are more atypical of their race than any other Human variant, which causes many of them to hide their abilities from adults who aren’t keen on the use of magic. Diverse and Determined Human customs are as diverse as their appearance, and attempting to group them into one race is an impossible task. However, what links humans together is their determination and perseverance. Throughout history, humans have pursued their dreams and spread throughout the land, sometimes through chaotic or brutal acts, but always with the goal of their survival. Looking back at their own actions in the growth of their cultures, humans have as a whole progressed towards peace and equality. Human Names Humans take on full names that sometimes also include a middle name. First and middle names are often named after a well-loved ancestor as a sign of respect. Names in general are borrowed from cultures all over Ne’Oor, even elvish or dwarvish ones, proving once again the diversity of the people on the whole. Sample First Names : Aon, Buck, Cade, Darla, Erik, Fen, Gregor, Haley, Imbur, Jackson, Kingsley, Loria, Mical, Pol, Quinn, Robb, Samual, Tanner, Wendell, Yari Sample Surnames : Bricken, Clarkeson, Fletcher, Foxcolt, Huntingsley, Lockend, Maxfort, Merrymore, Summersway Human Traits As a Human, you do not have any exotic abilities, but as you learn and borrow from other cultures, your skills grow. Ability Score Increase . Your ability scores each increase by 1. Age . Humans are seen to reach adulthood by the age of 18, although some mature a bit later than others. The average lifespan for a human is approximately 75 years old, although many live close to a century if they live peaceful and healthy lives. Alignment . Humans can be generous and lawful or greedy and evil (and everything in between). Wardling humans are always Good or Neutral, ranging from Lawful to Chaotic. Size . Humans are varied in size, with their height ranging from an average of 5 to 6 feet tall (and often taller). Their builds also range from very slender to athletic to hefty in size. No matter where an adult falls in that range, their size is Medium. If your older Wardling character is taller than 4 feet, their size is Medium as well, although most human children under 9 years old will be under 4 feet tall and their size is Small. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet if you are Medium sized or 25 feet if you are Small sized. Languages . You can speak, read, and write Common and one additional language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. If you live in an area with many Fey, you may know Sylvan. Live near the hilly areas below Icehelm or the mines under Silverbank? Perhaps you know how to speak Dwarvish or even Orcish, if you live near peaceful tribes. Choose any language you think may be useful and that matches your character’s story. ","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Renegade Game Studios","book":"Wardlings Campaign Guide"},{"name":"Human Branded Tribute","description":"Humans in the world Humans were the dominant humanoid race on most continents of Virthys. They had the strongest presence in the nations of Rhavun, theocratic countries that, with a few exceptions, were in constant conflict with each other. But they had their realms on other continents, too - with the exception of Zacrath. Also called the Realm of Venom, humans were not welcome in this land of snakes and other reptilian races. After the apocalypse, most humans tried to flock together with the other races - but especially with those that they already had good relations with. Many of them also turned to the old spirits again - from faeries to angels and devils. In the new world, many new pacts were made. This also brought back the \"tradition\" of human tributes. When the spirit world helped the humanoid races takes over the world, humans gave some of their own as offerings to the dark powers. They were branded with arcane irons, burning the symbols of their new owners into them. But not only the tributes were sold, but all their future offspring: Each and every descendant of such a human would show the evil mark. Called the Branded Tributes , most other humans stayed away from them - both out of fear and shame. Their souls and their lives were sold, but someone else claimed the prize. It's no wonder tribute humans were usually angry, even hateful, and many of them searched for ways to break free of the ancient deals. Most Branded Tribute Humans alive today are descendants of original \"offerings\" made thousands of years ago. But there are new ones, victims of people who are still aware of the old ways, gaining power by selling off others. The only prerequisite is that the tribute has to \"belong\" to the person making the deal. Children that haven't matured yet count for this as much as slaves. There are rumors about dark cults adopting children who have lost their parents in the apocalypse. They act as loving foster parents, but it doesn't take long before the poor youngsters are sold off to the forces of darkness. Human Branded Tributes A single symbol, about the size of a human palm, branded deep into the skin. It is no part of any language. No magic seems to be able to remove these signs. Even if they are cut out, they simply grow back. The tributes are branded for life, there's no doubt about it. The symbol can be on any part of the body, but in most cases, it's either on a cheek, the forehead or the neck, or on the chest. There are only few signs of a human being a tribute, aside from the mark. Their hair is either pitch black or entirely white, and at least at first glance, they appear extremely healthy: A tribute keeps perfect skin and teeth as well as muscular bodies until their very end. The one other thing that unites most of them is that they're either broken personalities, or they are really, really angry. Branding Rune of a Human Branded Tribute Children of original tributes usually grow up on the run from the dark powers. They rarely get away for long, for their evil masters can track them - and they have a purpose for these humans in mind. Sometimes, the parents have given in to servitude, and they raise their children as servants to their dark lords. Tributes that were sold off in the new world of Ashandri are often kept in the homes of their mortal masters or uncaring parents. Others are transported somewhere far away, and left in the wilderness to care for themselves. Branded Tributes are rarely accepted by other masters, which means they usually aren't warlocks, clerics or paladins. A higher power might choose to accept such a human without claiming their soul, or they might actually try to break the human free of the old bond. Such a confrontation of supernatural powers usually has a long-term impact not only on the human tribute, but on their companions as well. If you want to choose such a class for your character, weave an explanation for why you are accepted by your master into the story (or consult with your GM). Traits For a Branded Tribute human, the following Traits replace the original human’s Ability Score Increase trait. Age: Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century. Alignment: Branded Tribute Humans often despise evil, simply because their own souls were sold against their will by oppressors. While rare, there are evil Branded Tributes, too. Like all humans, they can be of any alignment. Size: Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the Languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their Speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc Curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish Military phrases, and so on. Ability Score Increase: Charisma+2, Strength+1 Suspicious: Your experiences have made you hypervigilant. When rolling for a Wisdom (Insight) or Wisdom (Perception) check, you roll an additional d4 and add the result to your Wisdom check. Fiery Backlash: When you take damage in battle, you can cast Hellish Rebuke as a first-level spell once with this trait. Your target has to roll for a Dexterity Saving Throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Proficiency modifier + your Charisma modifier. The target takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You regain the ability to cast it after finishing a long rest. Charisma is your Spellcasting ability for this spell. Dark Life: You can summon a dark energy from your tribute symbol. You can cast False Life as a first-level spell with this ability. Once used, you need a long rest before you can use it again. Charisma is your Spellcasting ability for this spell. Dark Enchantment: Once you've reached 5th level, you can call upon the same force that grants you Dark Life to enchant non-magical weapons. You can cast Magic Weapon as a second level spell. You regain the ability to cast it after finishing a long rest. Charisma is your Spellcasting ability for this spell. Cling to Life: You know that, when you die, your soul will end up with whoever bought it. When you have failed two Death Saving Throws, your next Death Saving Throw is made with advantage. Once used, you need a long rest before you can use this ability again.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Human Wardling","description":"“When does a man viewed as common become unique?

They are therefore the oldest, but not the most powerful species. Their advantage mostly lies in their adaptability to new situations as well as the strong will to explore and conquer the Earth. Our setting background is based on the worldview of Renaissance Europeans, so most of what you can read in the Bible about the creation and early history of humankind is believed to be true. Humans can be played without any changes to the standard description. Make sure, however, that human characters derive from a “real”, historically correct ethnicity. The ethnic groups of certain well-known fantasy settings will of course not exist in our 15th century setting. As Florence is well connected to the rest of the world, you are free to choose any nationality and background that you find interesting within the realm of the known world. Playing a Native American would make very little sense, as America will only be “discovered” later that year. The same goes for Australians and several peoples in Africa, who are not yet known to European society. And let us go a little further: In order to connect to the ongoings in our story and give you a strong motivation, we recommend that you choose an Italian background or at least one that is set in a country with strong connections to the Italian states. A Chinese monk would surely be an interesting choice, but – despite Marco Polo’s exploits – hard to integrate into the campaign. The more fitting you can make your character, the more fun you will have. Use our historical background material, as well as other sources, like history books or literary fiction, for inspiration. By the way: The singular masculine and feminine forms of umani are umano and umana. Human – Umani Traits Languages. You speak the language of the country you live in and one other human language, contemporary or ancient. You may choose additional languages according to your choice of background. Religion: Native Italians will usually be of Christian faith and adhere to the beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church, as do most other Europeans. Being Jewish is of course another valid option and with so many contacts in the Arab world, the Muslim faith also makes sense.

Being small and not particularly strong gives them a perspective that allows them to easily empathize with others, though not all jerbeens share this compassionate outlook. Some respond to the dangers outside their community by becoming insular and fearing all non-jerbeens. Jerbeens value privacy, but true isolation from friends, families, or loved ones is considered to be the worst possible fate a jerbeen could suffer. Jerbeen Traits Ability Score Increase.

They say in the beginning, all the world was a vast desert beneath a fiery sun; in those times, the jinnborn wandered where they willed and ruled over all they saw. They refer to themselves as the sab siraat, or “people of the path.” Descended from powerful elemental creatures called the Jinn (singular: jinni), the jinnborn manifest gifts through their lineage that help them survive their harsh home environment. Passionate people, the jinnborn seek wealth when they can, revel in revenge when they must, and cherish close companionship always. Outsiders label them as capricious or even savage, never fully understanding the jinnborn’s true nature. Touch of the Jinn Jinnborn are somewhat shorter than humans, rarely growing taller than 6 feet. Their shorter stature gives them a stocky build, and their frames are muscular and hardy—adults can easily weigh in excess of 170 pounds. Jinnborn skin tone comes in a wide range of colors, from sky blue to light violet and from golden to brick red. Secondary features such as nub horns, pointed teeth, or elemental gleams flickering deep within their eyes all mark the otherworldly heritage of the jinnborn. Nearly all jinnborn sport pointed ears, and they decorate themselves with jewelry of precious metals and gemstones. They prefer brightly colored, loose and flowing clothing, appropriate to the burning days and chilly nights. Paths to Plenty The core philosophy that drives jinnborn, regardless of their station, is siraati—a mystical path that jinnborn believe is their spiritual and cultural guide. Intrinsic to being sab siraat is the belief that the jinn who created the tribes set them on a path to the Hidden World, a land of plenty and fulfilled desire, free of the harsh desert realities, and unspoiled by the plots and greed of the pathless. Sab siraat are divided along elemental lines, like the jinn themselves, and each tribe adheres to a single path. Although every jinnborn tribe holds these paths sacred, no two agree on the specifics. Some common elements persist between siraati of different tribes, however, based on the elemental nature of the paths themselves. Air sab siraat are proud and aloof. Fire sab siraat are passionate and vicious. Water sab siraat are carefree but mercurial, and earth sab siraat are stoic and driven. Even with these tendencies, tribes exhibit great diversity in customs, laws, stories, and mannerisms. Some tribes boast multiple patron jinn and represent multiple forms of the siraati. Other tribes absorb members through conquest or marriage, giving them access to more than one elemental path. Once a jinnborn sets his or her mind upon a siraati, however, only the patron jinni’s intervention can change it. Life on the Path Tribes of jinnborn take the concept of mystical paths seriously, and they follow a nomadic lifestyle in accordance with those paths. Whether herding camels, following the supply of fresh water from oasis to river, or seeking wealth through trade, literal and philosophical paths govern all. The tribes follow the physical paths their elders set down, knowing these safe routes lead them around dangerous sands and past beguiling mirages to safety and sustenance. Other jinnborn tribes make their way as mercenaries or even turn to banditry. This is their path to the Hidden World. Outsiders frequently misread the jinnborn, though that is not entirely their fault. The jinnborn keep their word meticulously between themselves, but when dealing with the pathless outsiders, the line between what is said and what is meant blurs. They rarely lie outright, but they speak in terms that allow them to twist their meaning. Jinnborn who leave the desert can lose their connection to their siraati and their patron jinn. The longer they dwell away from the desert, the more they feel this separation approaching. If they remain away from the desert long enough, they become vulnerable to the predation of those opposed to their patron jinn or siraati, and their tribe or other jinnborn might shun them, feeling the absence within them. Patron Jinn Jinn share many traits with genies—the best-known of the powerful elementals—but they are more powerful still. Immortal beings older than recorded history, jinn contend with the sultans and emirs of the genie courts. Although jinnborn tribes often worship the jinn, they are not gods and grant no divine spells through belief alone. However, jinnborn warlocks nearly always choose their tribe’s patron jinni as their Otherworldly Patron, receiving the benefits granted by a Genie Lord patron (see Midgard Heroes Handbook or Deep Magic ). Jinnborn rarely worship any gods, for to do so strays from the path. Jinn are tied to one of the four elements and dwell on the corresponding elemental plane. They eschew the Material Plane unless dueling a rival on neutral ground or visiting their patron tribes. So ancient are the jinn that most no longer use their names. They do have formal names, and these names have been kept safe by the patron’s tribes. Jinnborn keep the name of the patron a close secret, and it is a deadly insult for a jinnborn to speak the name of another tribe’s patron. Jinnborn Names Jinnborn names borrow words from the elemental tongues and tend to contain few syllables. Male Names: Artis, Bel’ar, Djal, Fershul, Grunz, Jorlat, Masad, Parfal, Ri’un, Yvris Female Names: Alana, Bea’l, Cassal, Evelys, Falma, Himyra, Kayala, Nuli, Oshaa, Somnya Jinnborn Traits Your jinnborn character has certain characteristics in common with other jinnborn. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age. Jinnborn reach maturity at age 16 and can live to be over 150. Alignment. There is no single alignment among the jinnborn that typifies them all. Size. Jinnborn tend to be slightly shorter than humans, with stout, well-muscled builds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to your jinn blood, you can see in dim light within 60 feet as though it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Desert Dependent. At least once each year, you must spend 8 hours meditating in a desert or other warm, arid environment to reaffirm your siraati and your connection to your tribe’s patron jinn. If you refuse or are unable to meditate in this way, you lose sight of your siraati and your patron jinn, and you become vulnerable to a type of damage opposed to your siraati: bludgeoning (air), thunder (earth), cold (fire), or lightning (water). You must spend 48 hours meditating in a desert or other warm, arid environment to regain your lost connection, ending the damage vulnerability caused by the loss. Negotiator. You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill. Siraati. All jinnborn have an affinity for mystic paths, depending on the jinn patron of their tribe. Choose one of the following siraati: air, earth, fire, or water. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one of the four elemental languages (Auran, Aquan, Ignan, or Terran). The elemental language must conform to your siraati. Subrace. Jinnborn are divided into subraces depending on the innate touch of the jinn. Choose one of the following subraces. Jinnborn Feats The feats presented here reflect special talents jinnborn characters may gain due to their unique origins. Even if the optional rules for feats are in use in your campaign, check with your GM before adding any of these options to your character. Jinnborn of the Medina Truly Favored Warrior of the Hidden World Flowery Phrases of the Jinn The following phrases are common sayings among the jinnborn of the Dominion and the Crescent Desert: Dawn is when we gather. At dawn, the great flame warms air, earth, and water alike. A lamp cannot burn good intentions. Without a coin for oil, darkness prevails. Where there is smoke, there is fire. The question is, what does the fire want? Gilding their shackles does not dampen your slave’s hate. The only permanent cure for idiocy is death. Sweet words most often conceal bitter intent. The most dangerous hawk is the one who hides his talons. In the absence of light, every coin is gold. The sharpest blade cuts nothing in its sheath. A wise man rarely thinks of himself as such. Spilt water returns not to the well. You may spend a year crying or a year laughing. The year passes regardless.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Southlands Player's Guide"},{"name":"Kalashtar","description":"I am kalashtar, born of two worlds. Over a thousand years ago, my ancestor bound her bloodline to the spirit Kashtai, and I am a child of that union. Kashtai moves within me. Her memories come to me in dreams, and at times her voice whispers in the silence of my mind. As long as at least one of my sisters is alive, Kashtai will survive—and as long as she lives, she will fight il-Lashtavar. —Lakashtai, servant of the light The kalashtar are a compound people, created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams—spirits called quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits. Bound to Spirits Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can’t directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature of your linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers. The bond to the spirit can cause some kalashtar to display unusual quirks. Consider rolling or selecting a trait from the Kalashtar Quirks table. Kalashtar Quirks d10 Quirk 1 You try to understand the motives and feelings of your enemies. 2 You prefer using telepathy over speaking aloud. 3 You feel a strong drive to protect the innocent. 4 You apply dream logic to mundane situations. 5 You discuss things out loud with your quori spirit. 6 You suppress your emotions and rely on logic. 7 You are strongly influenced by the emotions of those around you. 8 You prefer to find nonviolent solutions to problems whenever possible. 9 You are driven by a warrior spirit and will fight for any noble cause. 10 You are obsessed with Dreaming Dark conspiracies. Hunted by Nightmares The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible. Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings. Kalashtar Names A kalashtar name adds a personal prefix to the name of the quori spirit within the kalashtar. Such names have no relation to the kalashtar’s gender. Kalashtar orphans are unlikely to know the name of their spirit and take names from another source. Quori Names: Ashana, Ashtai, Ishara, Hareth, Khad, Kosh, Melk, Nari, Tana, Tari, Tash, Ulad, Vakri, Vash Kalashtar Names: Coratash, Dalavash, Dolishara, Halakosh, Khoratari, Koratana, Lanhareth, Molavakri, Nevitash, Sorashana, Torashtai, Valakhad, Vishara Kalashtar Traits Your kalashtar character has the following traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Age. Kalashtar mature and age at the same rate as humans. Alignment. The noble spirit tied to a kalashtar drives it toward lawful and good behavior. Most kalashtar combine strong self-discipline with compassion for all beings, but some kalashtar resist the virtuous influence of their spirit. Size. Your size is Medium. To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier: Size modifier = 2d6 Height = 5 feet + 4 inches + your size modifier in inches Weight in pounds = 110 + (1d6 × your size modifier) Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Dual Mind. You have advantage on all Wisdom saving throws. Mental Discipline. You have resistance to psychic damage. Mind Link. You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see, provided the creature is within a number of feet of you equal to 10 times your level. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. When you’re using this trait to speak telepathically to a creature, you can use your action to give that creature the ability to speak telepathically with you for 1 hour or until you end this effect as an action. To use this ability, the creature must be able to see you and must be within this trait’s range. You can give this ability to only one creature at a time; giving it to a creature takes it away from another creature who has it. Severed from Dreams. Kalashtar sleep, but they don’t connect to the plane of dreams as other creatures do. Instead, their minds draw from the memories of their otherworldly spirit while they sleep. As such, you are immune to spells and other magical effects that require you to dream, like dream , but not to spells and other magical effects that put you to sleep, like sleep . Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Quori, and one other language of your choice.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":4480},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Eberron - Rising from the Last War"},{"name":"Keenok","description":"Keenoks are tall and muscular humanoids with teal or purple skin and tentacle-like appendages flowing from their scalps.

We approached our destination without issue, but as we arrived at the burned-out building, a sudden cacophony erupted around us. Birds squawked, cats hissed, and dogs growled. Lidda hustled us back to the city’s safer avenues. Only when we were back within the area patrolled by the guard did she explain that the noises indicated that the wingless folk had claimed that area, and that to trespass would be to court death. —Gimble, Notes from a Treasure Hunter Haunted by an ancient crime that robbed them of their wings, the kenku wander the world as vagabonds and burglars who live at the edge of human society. Kenku suffer from a sinister reputation that is not wholly unearned, but they can prove to be valuable allies. An Ancient Curse The kenku once served a mysterious, powerful entity on another plane of existence. Some believe they were minions of Grazz’t, while others say that they were scouts and explorers for the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Whatever the truth, according to legend, the kenku betrayed their master. Unable to resist the lure of a beautiful sparkling treasure, the kenku plotted to steal the item and escape to the Material Plane. Unfortunately for the kenku, their master discovered their plan before they could enact it. Enraged, the entity imposed three dreadful curses upon them. First, the kenku’s beloved wings withered and fell away from their bodies, leaving them bound to the earth. Second, because their ingenuity and skill had turned toward scheming against their patron, the spark of creativity was torn from their souls. Finally, to ensure that the kenku could never divulge any secrets, their master took away their voices. Once the entity was satisfied that they had been sufficiently punished, the kenku were set loose on the Material Plane. Since then, the kenku have wandered the world. They settle in places that accept them, usually bleak cities that have fallen on hard times and are overrun with crime. Dreams of Flight Above all else, kenku wish to regain their ability to fly. Every kenku is born with a desire to take to the air, and those who learn spellcasting do so in hope of mastering spells that will allow them to fly. Rumors of magic items such as flying carpets, brooms capable of flight, and similar objects provoke a great desire for the kenku to acquire the items for themselves. Despite their lack of wings, kenku love dwelling in towers and other tall structures. They seek out ruins that reach to the sky, though they lack the motivation and creativity to make repairs or fortify such places. Even so, their light weight and size allow them to dwell in rickety structures that would collapse beneath a human or an orc. Some thieves’ guilds use kenku as lookouts and messengers. The kenku dwell in the tallest buildings and towers the guild controls, allowing them to lurk in the highest levels and to keep watch on the city below. Hopeless Plagiarists As a result of their lack of creativity, kenku function comfortably as minions of a powerful master. Flock leaders enforce discipline and minimize conflicts, but they fail at effective planning or crafting long-term schemes. Although unable to speak in their own voices, kenku can perfectly mimic any sound they hear, from a half­ling’s voice to the noise of rocks clattering down a hillside. However, kenku cannot create new sounds and can communicate only by using sounds they have heard. Most kenku use a combination of overheard phrases and sound effects to convey their ideas and thoughts. By the same token, kenku have no ability to invent new ideas or create new things. Kenku can copy existing items with exceptional skill, allowing them to become excellent artisans and scribes. They can copy books, make replicas of objects, and otherwise thrive in situations where they can produce large numbers of identical items. Few kenku find this work satisfying, since their quest for the freedom of flight makes them ill-suited to settle into a routine. Ideal Minions Kenku gather in groups called flocks. A flock is led by the oldest and most experienced kenku with the widest store of knowledge to draw on, often called Master. Although kenku can’t create new things, they have a talent for learning and memorizing details. Thus, ambitious kenku can excel as superb spies and scouts. A kenku who learns of clever schemes and plans devised by other creatures can put them to use. The kenku lack the talent to improvise or alter a plan, but a wise Master sets multiple plans in motion at once, confident that underlings can follow orders to the letter. For this reason, many kenku make an easy living serving as messengers, spies, and lookouts for thieves’ guilds, bandits, and other criminal cartels. A network of kenku can relay a bird call or similar noise across the city, alerting their allies to the approach of a guard patrol or signaling a prime opportunity for a robbery. Since kenku can precisely reproduce any sound, the messages they carry rarely suffer degradation or shifts in meaning. Human messengers might switch words or phrases and garble a message inadvertently, but the kenku produce perfect copies of whatever they hear. Kenku Adventurers Kenku adventurers are usually the survivors of a flock that has sustained heavy losses, or a rare kenku who has grown weary of a life of crime. These kenku are more ambitious and daring than their fellows. Others strike out on their own in search of the secrets of flight, to master magic, or to uncover the secret of their curse and find a method to break it. Kenku adventurers, despite their relative independence, still have a tendency to seek out a companion to emulate and follow. A kenku loves to mimic the voice and words of its chosen companion. Kenku Names Given that kenku can duplicate any sound, their names are drawn from a staggering variety of noises and phrases. Kenku names tend to break down into three categories that make no distinction between male and female names. Kenku thugs, warriors, and toughs adopt noises made by weapons, such as the clang of a mace against armor or the sound made by a breaking bone. Non-kenku refer to the kenku by describing this noise. Examples of this type of name include Smasher, Clanger, Slicer, and Basher. Kenku thieves, con artists, and burglars adopt animal noises, typically those common in urban settings. In this manner, kenku can call out to each other while those who overhear them mistake them for common animals. Non-kenku use names that refer to the sound made or the animal a kenku mimics, such as Rat Scratch, Whistler, Mouser, and Growler. Some kenku turn their back on crime to pursue legitimate trades. These kenku adopt noises made as part of their craft. A sailor duplicates the sound of a fluttering sail, while a smith mimics the clanging of a hammer on metal. Non-kenku describe these folk by their trade sounds, such as Sail Snap, Hammerer, and Cutter. Kenku Traits Your kenku character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase.

Roleplaying a Kenku If you’re playing a kenku, constant attempts to mimic noises can come across as confusing or irritating rather than entertaining. You can just as easily describe the sounds your character makes and what they mean. Be clear about your character’s intentions unless you’re deliberately aiming for inscrutable or mysterious. You might say, “Snapper makes the noise of a hammer slowly and rhythmically tapping a stone to show how bored he is. He plays with his dagger and studies the Lords’ Alliance agent sitting at the bar.” Creating a vocabulary of noises for the other players to decode might sound like fun, but it can prove distracting and could slow down the game.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Volo's Guide to Monsters"},{"name":"Kenku","description":"Feathered folk who resemble ravens, kenku are blessed with keen observation and supernaturally accurate memories.

Their voices were once heard across entire planes, calling the dead to the Raven Queen’s embrace. The kenku likewise served as her loyal warriors in the Calamity, and even saved her from a near-fatal encounter with the Betrayer God known as Tharizdun. Though the kenku saved the Raven Queen from oblivion, all of her black-winged emissaries were consumed by Tharizdun’s infinite void. For long years, the kenku were thought to have been annihilated, and it was only when Tharizdun was defeated and chained by the god Ioun near the Calamity’s end that they were freed. When the gods sealed themselves behind the Divine Gate, the Raven Queen realized what her emissaries had sacrificed to save her. Though the kenku survived oblivion, they returned as mortals, stripped of all the divine gifts their god had bestowed on them: their voices, their wings, and all memories of their past existence. Bearing Tharizdun’s curse of oblivion, the kenku were reduced to squat beings that could speak only by mimicking the words of others. Kenku exist across Wildemount in small numbers. Considered by most to be monsters, they keep to themselves as a result, always longing for something they can neither ask for nor explain. Something in a kenku’s mind stirs when it looks to the sky and see birds flying freely—an ancient longing, and a memory trapped within oblivion.

Sample names include Smasher, Clanger, Slicer, and Basher. Kenku thieves, con artists, and burglars adopt animal noises, typically those common in urban settings. In this manner, kenku can call out to each other while those who overhear them mistake them for common animals. Non-kenku use names that refer to the sound made or the animal a kenku mimics, such as Rat Scratch, Whistler, Mouser, and Growler. Some kenku are law-abiding and pursue legitimate trades. These kenku adopt noises made as part of their craft. A sailor duplicates the sound of a fluttering sail, while a smith mimics the clanging of a hammer on metal. Non-kenku describe these folk by their trade sounds, such as Sail Snap, Hammerer, and Cutter. Roleplaying a Kenku If you're playing a kenku, constant attempts to mimic voices can come across as confusing or irritating rather than entertaining. You can just as easily describe the sounds your character makes and what they mean. Be clear about your character's intentions unless you're deliberately aiming for inscrutable or mysterious. You might say, \"Snapper makes the noise of a hammer slowly and rhythmically tapping a stone to show how bored he is. He plays with his dagger and studies the Cobalt Soul agent sitting at the bar.\" Creating a vocabulary of noises for the other players to decode might sound like fun, but it can prove distracting and could slow down the game.

Their voices were once heard across entire planes, calling the dead to the Raven Queen’s embrace. The kenku likewise served as her loyal warriors in the Calamity, and even saved her from a near-fatal encounter with the Betrayer God known as Tharizdun. Though the kenku saved the Raven Queen from oblivion, all of her black-winged emissaries were consumed by Tharizdun’s infinite void. For long years, the kenku were thought to have been annihilated, and it was only when Tharizdun was defeated and chained by the god Ioun near the Calamity’s end that they were freed. When the gods sealed themselves behind the Divine Gate, the Raven Queen realized what her emissaries had sacrificed to save her. Though the kenku survived oblivion, they returned as mortals, stripped of all the divine gifts their god had bestowed on them: their voices, their wings, and all memories of their past existence. Bearing Tharizdun’s curse of oblivion, the kenku were reduced to squat beings that could speak only by mimicking the words of others. Kenku exist across Wildemount in small numbers. Considered by most to be monsters, they keep to themselves as a result, always longing for something they can neither ask for nor explain. Something in a kenku’s mind stirs when it looks to the sky and see birds flying freely—an ancient longing, and a memory trapped within oblivion.

Imagine spending your life wandering the stars hoping to be that lucky lottery winner that finds the home that once was. And if you don’t, it gets passed down to your next generation. Even with all that, they’re friendlier than the lizards and a lot less stuffy than the glowy folk in the suits. If you haven’t done one of those memory-melds with a kesh, make sure you try it at least once. You’ll be in for a treat, for sure. ” — Sanrod Trenton, human technician Before all else, the kesh are a people bred for exploration. No longer having a world to call home, they have spent centuries living either within the realms of other peoples, or aboard massive starships built to traverse new regions within the infinite expanse. Simply Complex Upon first meeting a kesh, it can sometimes be difficult to gauge their expressions. Over time, however, certain minute facial features and gestures become easily recognizable. The same cannot be said for other kesh, who recognize these slight inflections instantly. This is partly due to their native language, which includes a number of facial expressions in combination with their speech. Kesh are slightly shorter than an average human, though their builds can vary. They have no hair on their bodies at all. Their skin appears extremely smooth, but has a slight rubbery texture when touched. Their skintones range between shades of pale greens and browns. All kesh have pitch black eyes that cast a shadowy reflection when gazed into. Gone but Not Forgotten In the earliest recorded history of the kesh, legend speaks of a homeworld that was a beacon of light and prosperity within the galaxy. However, through their arrogance, the kesh’s world was swallowed by a great darkness from which they never truly recovered. The survivors of this ancient people abandoned their home to become wanderers among the stars, and in following centuries lost all knowledge of its location. Through this lesson of history, the kesh have come to follow a path of exploration and enlightenment. They do this hoping that one day they will rediscover their lost homeworld, and return there not only as a better people, but as an evolved society worthy of the glory of their former home. A Life of Discovery There is no greater purpose amongst the kesh than to gain enlightenment from other societies while sharing their learned experience with each other. The elders among the kesh call this “The Great Renewal.” Kesh have the ability to “share” their experiences with other kesh though a ritual of minor telepathy when they are in close range. This act must be mutually accepted between all parties, and is a tool that helps each of their species become more aware of the universe around them. Though even the oldest of their kind is unclear of what their people face once the kesh rediscover their lost home, they are certain that this time, they will be ready to overcome whatever still lies in wait. Kesh Names A kesh name has two different variants, depending on their social situation. Their birth name does not change. In situations where they are in a formal setting or when meeting strangers, they use their family’s crew designation as their surname, preceded by the word “fel”, meaning “part of” in their native language. In more personable or informal situations, a kesh can reveal their family name. Unless they are amongst allies, close associates, and friends, revealing a family name is considered disrespectful to their crew. Male Names: Aldon, Balo, Calet, Druso, Eruka, Finli, Gento, Karul, Lysin, Mirul, Misrym, Neri, Remis, Sakol, Tesso Female Names: Adrine, Atalya, Calli, Dalil, Elona, Fayliah, Ilethi, Ladisia, Mereia, Nisuri, Oree, Piriele, Riel, Truna, Vanika Crew Names (preceded by “fel”): Astalir, Cojiva, Gaevo, Jojari, Medoran, Sherfin, Velark, Wotamo, Xuxor, Zehali Family Names: Gage, Hiyul, Kiet, Larik, Mosh, Noram, Nuel, Seon, Toski, Yarit Kesh Traits The kesh possess a number of advantages due to their adaptive nature passed down through generations. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity increases by 2. Age. Kesh take longer to reach what is considered “adulthood” to their species, ranging between 40 and 50 years. They are known to have a lifespan of close to 500 years, but there are rumors of a small group of kesh who have lived centuries longer. Alignment. Kesh are explorers first and foremost. Because they often deal with various species and cultures, they tend to be neutral in alignment with a leaning toward good. Size. Kesh average between 4.5 to 5.5 ft. in height and tend toward slim to slightly stocky builds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. With generations of adapting to various planetary climates as well as the vastness of space, kesh have the ability to see well in dim and dark places. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were in dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Languages. You speak, read, and write Common, Keshian, and one other language of your choice. Expert Explorer. You are proficient in the Survival skill. Minor Alteration. You gain use of the alter appearance talent. You can use this talent once, after which you must complete a long rest before you can use it again. Even when using this feature, you are unable to change the natural black eye color that is native to all kesh. At 4th level, you gain an additional use of this feature and can extend the duration for one additional hour. This increases by one use and one additional hour again at 9th level and 14th level. You regain all uses of this feature when you complete a long rest. Memory Meld. You gain use of the shared vision power. You can use it once after which you must complete a long rest before it can be used again. Charisma is your channeling ability for this power when you use this feature.

As I traversed that secluded valley with its majestic river I discovered how wrong I was. Their civilization, long hidden, had flourished in the shadows of the mountains. —Darius Stryx, cartographer On the banks of a mystic river, in a region secluded from the outside world, there is a clay that can be shaped, fired, and filled with an alchemical concoction that transmutes these raw materials into new life. The people created in this way, the kilnkin, are deeply religious. Pottery, alchemy, and a cultural system that divides individuals into castes form the basis of their society. As a rule, kilnkin are calm and peaceful; but when the situation demands it, they are capable of great feats beyond the physical and mental limitations of most other humanoids. Forged in Fire The mystical and alchemical processes that allow kilnkin to gain sentience require specific dimensions: all kilnkin are exactly 5 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds upon creation. Their bodies are predominantly made of red, blue, or yellow clay. Their eyes burn with the ongoing alchemical fire that animates them, and their bodies are covered in indentations of runic patterns, within which flows metallic liquids. After the sentience of a kilnkin is catalyzed, they are free to modify their bodies as they wish. Kilnkin often create ornamental pottery to adorn themselves with and paint their bodies in bright colors. Kilnkin can also modify their body by incorporating clays and alchemical reagents other than those they were created with. These kilnkin exhibit a patchwork of colors or, more rarely, a blend of them. Mote & Anima The role of individual kilnkin in their society is based on the primary clay used in their creation, called their mote, and the primary alchemical agent involved in their animation, called their anima. Each kilnkin has a mote and an anima for a total of nine possible combinations. In the traditional kilnkin understanding of the world, an individual’s combination reveals their duty to kilnkin society, personality, temperament, and destiny. This emphasis on the significance of mote and anima adds to the kilnkin skepticism of other peoples, who are seen as inconsistent and unpredictable. Alchemical Adventurers Kilnkin rarely leave the safety and serenity of their enclave. In the past, meetings with the wider world worked out poorly for the philosophically minded kilnkin, causing them to become insular and distrustful of other peoples. This history means that kilnkin who become adventurers are often outsiders or outcasts among their own people. More rarely, a kilnkin elder will empower a younger kilnkin to leave the community to strike out into the world for resources, intelligence gathering, or some other mission. Kilnkin that leave the safety of their people for any reason must perform a special purification ritual before they are allowed to return to their own kind. Kilnkin Names Kilnkin are not given names in their youth and instead are referred to as “child” with whatever descriptors are necessary to differentiate them from other young kilnkin. Once they reach maturity, kilnkin name themselves. Adult Names: Arsixsixy, Bezalel, Chappie, Daimajin, Galatea, Kaddish, Prometheus, Pulgasari, Saint Kilnkin Traits All kilnkin share the following traits. Ability Score Increase. Kilnkin are a diverse people with natural strength and talents dictated by their mote and anima. One ability score of your choice that is increased by your mote or anima subrace increases by an additional 1. Age. Kilnkin reach maturity quicker than many other races, reaching full maturity at the age of 5. The oldest kilnkin rarely live beyond 100 years. Alignment. A traditional people, most Kilnkin are lawful. They tend towards good or neutral. Size. What variation exists between the kilnkin is entirely dependent on their dress, behavior, and body modifications. The alchemical process that animates them requires all kilnkin to stand exactly 5 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your basic walking speed is 30. Alchemical Resilience. Your alchemical physiology renders you exceptionally hardy to many dangers. You have resistance against poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against poison. Additionally, you are immune to disease. Exceed Mortal Limits. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause the alchemical processes animating you to grant you the ability to exceed mortal limitations. For the next minute, you ignore the effects of any exhaustion levels you have. At the end of this minute, you gain a level of exhaustion. Once you use this trait, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Prog enitor’s Expertise. You have proficiency with alchemist’s supplies and potter’s tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either proficiency. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Subraces. Each kilnkin is an intersection between their primary material components, represented by their mote subrace, and those of their primary animating alchemical substance, represented by their anima subrace. Choose one mote subrace and one anima subrace.

Enslaved long ago by reaver dwarves, kobolds quickly carved a niche for themselves as miners, scouts, and tinkerers: small enough to be useful, and also small enough to be dismissed as a threat. At first they were tolerated, then largely ignored. As a result, the shadows of dwarven society are rife with kobold rogues and entrepreneurs (many of them secret worshippers of Loki), seemingly subservient but busily trading dwarven goods for resources extracted from the dwarves’ own mines and storehouses, right under the noses of their “masters.” Free kobolds defend their mines viciously but otherwise maintain the ruse of a harmless and subservient little folk—at least until the opportunity to sheathe a knife in someone’s kidneys presents itself. Many other small races have adopted the kobold’s strategy, including the worship of Loki, embracing his cunning ways and the advantages of guile and cunning over brawn and bravado. Subterranean Survivors More than anything, kobolds are survivors. Their scaly skin and keen night vision as well as their dextrous claws and sensitive snouts make them quick to sense danger, and their clawed feet move them out of danger with cowardly speed. They are small but fierce when fighting on their own terms, and their weight of numbers helps them survive in places where larger but less numerous races can’t sustain a settlement. They are great miners, good gearsmiths, and modest alchemists, and they have a curiosity about the world that frequently gets them into trouble. They are merchants to both the surface world and the world beneath it, with their greatest cities hidden deep below the earth. Their enemies are the diabolical gnomes, the dwarves, and any other mining races that seek dominance of dark, rich territories. The kobold King of Kings rules from Harkesh, the capital of the Dragon Empire, where kobolds form a large middle class known as the kobaldi. Some even own human and dwarven slaves. Here, kobolds carry themselves upright, see themselves as naturally superior to the hairy races, and swagger about their business. Mharoti kobolds loudly demand the respect of others and greatly disconcert those accustomed to the paranoid and sniveling kobolds found in the rest of Midgard. That same sniveling still goes on, but the kobaldi reserve it for their dragon masters. Finding One's Place Kobold society is gregarious and built around the clan, matriarchal lines of descent, male kings, and the crucial importance of clutch-mates (those who hatched about the same time, the closest things kobolds have to brothers and sisters). Few kobolds become adventurers, and most of those who do have either offended a kobold king (and been exiled from the mines as punishment) or have lost many or all of their clutch-mates (so they leave home to grieve and to find new friends). In many cases, a kobold “adopts” an adventuring party as new clutch-mates. Kobolds are deeply enamored of their tools. Some kobolds spend a great deal of effort improving them. Mining picks, a mason’s hammer, jeweler’s loupe, and even simple items like a kobold’s spear or dagger are all named and cherished. At the same time, kobolds tend to gnaw on tool handles, forget to oil blades, or even pry out inlays or decorative gems (to polish or reshape them) without first considering how they’ll repair the damage. As a result, most kobold items are distinctive and unlikely to be mistaken for anyone else’s items. Some believe this decorative urge is an instinctual defense against theft. One category of tool deserves special note: traps. Kobolds create simple, deadly traps and wildly impractical ones as a hobby. Few kobolds leave home without string, springs, simple latches, and other bits and pieces that can be quickly fashioned into triggers for traps. Kobolds are the only race that recognizes “trapsmith” as a profession. Kobolds are closely allied with and related to dragonkin, drakes, and dragons. The kobold kings (and there are oh-so-many kobold kings, since no kobold ruler is satisfied with being merely a chieftain) admire dragons as the greatest sources of wisdom, power, and proper behavior. Kobold Names Among themselves, kobold names tend to be a combination of yips, howls, snarls, coughing sounds, and sounds made by clacking their teeth. These words are difficult, if not impossible, for other races to duplicate, so kobolds who go out into the world usually adopt another, simpler name. These can be anything the kobold likes the sound of, and often come from another culture; some kobolds are partial to dwarven names, for example, mainly for ironic reasons. Alternatively, they can take descriptive labels, usually with an incongruous gravitas or a ridiculous implication of power, such as Worldshaker, Thor Giantslayer, or Spinecrusher. There’s no real consistency or pattern to the names they use among outsiders. Kobold Traits Your kobold character has certain characteristics in common with all other kobolds. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Intelligence score increases by 1. Age. Kobolds reach maturity at age 10, and can live to nearly 80. Alignment.

Legends tell of the first kobolds emerging from the Underdark near the lairs of the earliest dragons. In some lands, kobolds serve chromatic or metallic dragons—even worshiping them as divine beings. In other places, kobolds know too well how dangerous those dragons can be and help others defend against draconic destruction. Whatever their relationship to dragons, kobold scales tend to be rust colored, although the occasional kobold sports a scale color more akin to that of a chromatic or a metallic dragon. A kobold’s cry can express a range of emotion: anger, resolve, elation, fear, and more. Regardless of the emotion expressed, their cry resonates with draconic power.

Lemurian man had ‘imbibed the physical and chemical forces inherent in lifeless things,’ and had but to look at objects to judge their weight-bearing capacity. Thus he could build and erect without recourse to the arts of engineering, and could lift enormous weights by the exercise of will-power alone. Will-power, was, indeed, the particular quality in which the Lemurians were transcendent.” —Lewis Spence, The Problem of Lemuria: The Sunken Continent of the Pacific Once upon a time, Lemuria was the envy of all its neighbors. With advanced theories of magic and the resources to turn those sophisticated concepts into practical applications, the people of Lemuria were free from the mundane business of making a living to pursue personal interests and relationships. Raiders came to their shores and crashed uselessly against the walls of their great cities, eager to access the network of interconnected magical items that ensured Lemuria’s ongoing prosperity. After hundreds of years of increasing isolation, the people of Lemuria grew weary of the world and decided to leave it. A Whiter Shade of Pale There are two physical features that set lemurians apart from many of the other races in the worlds of D&D: their skin is devoid of pigment and they have a third eye above the center of their brow. Lemurian hair is silver, gray, or white. Their eyes can be nearly any color. In lemurian culture there is a belief that eye color says a lot about one’s personality similar to the astrology practiced by other races. Perhaps owing to the relative scarcity of food stuffs in the ethereal realm, lemurians have slight builds. They stand between 4 feet and 5 feet tall and weigh 65 to 85 pounds. Lemurians who pass their adolescence in the material realm stand a bit taller and broader than those raised in the ethereal. Intangible Exodus When lemurians left the Material Plane, they took the land they lived on with them. The ritual they performed shifted their entire continent into the Border Ethereal. For a time they continued to travel between their new home and their old. When they desired greater isolation they worked new rituals to push their home into the Deep Ethereal. The story of Lemuria ends there. Surviving lemurian records state that as their people continued to advance in arcane lore and its practical uses they began to fade out of existence. This phenomena became known as “Ascension” and the majority of lemurians pursued it until only a fraction of the people remained that once made up the great civilization. Some still haunt the forgotten ruins of Lemuria but others have wandered back into the Border Ethereal or even crossed over into the Material Plane. Haunting the Border Since the fall of Lemuria, lemurians have formed tribes and migrated back from the Deep Ethereal to the Border Ethereal. Each tribe has developed its own customs to honor their ancestors and placate the odd denizens of the Ethereal Plane. Lemurian tribes treasure artifacts from Lemuria and hold them with great reverence. At times, conflicts over the possession of these artifacts escalates into war between lemurian tribes. Much of what lemurians know about the Material Plane comes from what they have observed by looking through the border or have talked about with ghosts or other creatures who can pass between the planes easily. Lemurians are curious, observant, and can be obsessive about their interests and uncovering secrets. Lemurians prefer to watch situations unfold from a distance and only get involved once they feel confident they have all the information they need to make an informed decision or take decisive action. Out of the Ethereal Lemurians share some of the reasons members of other races become adventurers and are also powerfully motivated by curiosity. Those who have only recently made their way to the Material Plane are eager to see as much of this vibrant world as they can. Lemurians who’ve been in the Material Plane for some time might be interested in finding ancient artifacts that connect them to the history of Lemuria and its people. Lemurian Names In Lemuria it was common practice to name newborns after mystic principles and theories that were relevant to the parents’ hopes for the child. Although few lemurians know the full significance of these words today, by tradition this naming convention has continued on. Lemurians use the name of their tribe as their surname with most tribes being named after the cities of Lemuria.

If they remain in the Ethereal Plane they live to nearly 300 years old but lemurians who venture out of the Border Ethereal into the Material Plane typically do not live longer than 200 years. Alignment. Lemurians are reserved by nature and rarely interfere in the struggles of others. Most lemurians are lawful neutral or neutral. Size. Lemurians are slightly shorter and significantly slighter than humans. They stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 65 to 85 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30. Ethereal Step. As a bonus action, you become partially ethereal until the start of your next turn. While partially ethereal, you have resistance to nonmagical damage, you have a flying speed equal to your base walking speed, and you can move through occupied spaces. If you end your turn in an occupied space, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. Once you use this trait, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Third Eye. You have a third eye above the middle of your brow. You have advantage on saving throws against being blinded. Vision Beyond Sight. You can take an action on your turn to open your third eye to vision beyond sight for one minute. While your third eye is open, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. You are immune to being blinded while this ability is in use. If you were blinded before engaging this ability, that condition ends immediately. Once you use this trait, you must finish a long rest until you can use it again. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common. When lemurians left the Material Plane hundreds or thousands of years ago, an earlier form of Common was spoken. Today lemurians continue to use many of the words, phrases, and linguistic rules of that older version of the language which sounds distinctly odd to those who speak the Common of modernity.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Sterling Vermin Adventuring Co.","book":"The Ultimate Adventurer's Handbook"},{"name":"Leonin","description":"Leonin The leonin guard the shining lands of Oreskos, a golden plain where even the gods rarely trespass. Prides of these nomadic, lion-like humanoids rarely interact with other peoples, having all they need in their shimmering homeland and knowing the treachery of strangers. Still, some leonin wonder what lies beyond Oreskos's border mountains and seek to test themselves in a wider world. Noble and Fierce Leonin tend to be tall compared to humans and move with a boldness that suggests their physical might. Tawny fur covers leonin bodies, and some grow thick manes ranging in shades from gold to black. While their hands prove as nimble as those of other humanoids, leonin have retractable feline claws, which they can extend instantly. This, along with their ability to produce bone-shaking roars, gives most leonin an air that readily shifts between regal and fearsome. Leonin often act with confidence, which can come off as imperiousness. While this can reassure their allies, it can also suggest defiance in the face of what they perceive as imposed authority or unworthy experts. Quick to Quarrel Other peoples often perceive leonin as quick to take offense, intolerant of criticism, or belligerent. The truth is that many leonin simply enjoy fighting, whether verbal or physical. They take pleasure in argument, wrestling, sparring, and even battle, enjoying the opportunity to exercise their minds and bodies. It follows, too, that leonin aren't inclined to carry grudges. A warrior might react with sudden violence to an insult, but when the fight is over (and the leonin's superiority proven), the insult is forgotten—along with the vanquished foe. Pride and Self-Reliance Few leonin devote themselves to the service of the gods. Centuries ago, the leonin worshiped the same gods that humans do, but after many of their prides suffered depravities at the hands of the tyrant Agnomakhos, most leonin rejected the gods. It's not that they deny the existence of deities; they merely see the gods as mercurial and ultimately unworthy of adoration. The Leonin and the Gods table suggests the range of attitudes that leonin might adopt toward the gods. Leonin rely on themselves and their prides. A pride is bound together by the experience of a shared challenge and, in particular, the sacred act of the hunt. See chapter 3 for more details on Oreskos and the leonin who call that land home. Leonin and the Gods d6 Attitude 1 I’m amused by the antics of the gods and their earnest, but ultimately deluded, mortal champions, and I feel smugly superior in my detachment. 2 The meddling of the gods in mortal affairs makes me angry and bitter. I wish they would just leave us all alone! 3 I view the gods as worthy adversaries—incredibly clever and well-prepared to play a long game but ultimately doomed to lose their games. 4 I’m certain every bad thing that happens can ultimately be blamed on the gods, but I roll my eyes at each new twist of fate and try to get on with my life. 5 I wish that I could be as naive as humans and other mortals who actually think the gods are looking out for them. I miss that kind of innocence. 6 I don’t talk about it among other leonin, but I actually revere the gods and try to please them by my actions. Leonin Names Along with their personal names, leonin identify themselves by their pride. A member of the Flintclaw pride with the personal name of Ziore, for example, would likely style herself as Ziore of the Flintclaw. Female Names: Aletha, Atagone, Demne, Doxia, Ecate, Eriz, Gragonde, Iadma, Koila, Oramne, Seza, Ziore Male Names: Apto, Athoz, Baragon, Bryguz, Eremoz, Gorioz, Grexes, Oriz, Pyxathor, Teoz, Xemnon, Xior Pride Names: Embereye, Flintclaw, Goldenfield, Ironmane, Starfeller, Sunguides Leonin matrons lead the prides of Oreskos, protecting the plains from interlopers. Leonin Traits Your leonin character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1. Age. Leonin mature and age at about the same rate as humans. Alignment. Leonin tend toward good alignments. Leonin who are focused on the pride lean toward lawful good. Size. Leonin are typically over 6 feet tall, with some standing over 7 feet. Your size is Medium. Here's how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier: Size modifier = 2d10 Height = 5 feet + 6 inches + your size modifier in inches Weight in pounds = 180 + (2d6 × your size modifier) Speed. Your base walking speed is 35 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Claws. Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you can deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Hunter's Instincts. You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, or Survival. Daunting Roar. As a bonus action, you can let out an especially menacing roar. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. The DC of the save equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Leonin.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Mythic Odysseys of Theros"},{"name":"Lizardfolk","description":"If you’re considering taking a scaled one along on an adventure, remember this important fact. The strange, inhuman glint in its eyes as it looks you over is the same look you might give a freshly grilled steak. —Tordek, dwarf fighter and adventurer Only a fool looks at the lizardfolk and sees nothing more than scaly humanoids. Their physical shape notwithstanding, lizardfolk have more in common with iguanas or dragons than they do with humans, dwarves, or elves. Lizardfolk possess an alien and inscrutable mindset, their desires and thoughts driven by a different set of basic principles than those of warm-blooded creatures. Their dismal swamp homes might lie hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins is far greater. Despite their alien outlook, some lizardfolk make an effort to understand and, in their own manner, befriend people of other races. Such lizardfolk make faithful and skilled allies. Alien Minds The lizardfolk’s reptilian nature comes through not only in their appearance, but also in how they think and act. Lizardfolk experience a more limited emotional life than other humanoids. Like most reptiles, their feelings largely revolve around fear, aggression, and pleasure. Lizardfolk experience most feelings as detached descriptions of creatures and situations. For example, humans confronted by an angry troll experience fear on a basic level. Their limbs shake, their thinking becomes panicked and jumbled, and they react by instinct. The emotion of fear takes hold and controls their actions. In contrast, lizardfolk see emotions as traits assigned to other creatures, objects, and situations. A lizardfolk doesn’t think, “I’m scared.” Instead, aggressive, stronger creatures register to the lizardfolk as fearsome beings to be avoided if possible. If such creatures attack, lizardfolk flee, fighting only if cornered. Lizardfolk aren’t scared of a troll; instead, they understand that a troll is a fearsome, dangerous creature and react accordingly. Lizardfolk never become angry in the way others do, but they act with aggression toward creatures that they could defeat in a fight and that can’t be dealt with in some other manner. They are aggressive toward prey they want to eat, creatures that want to harm them, and so on. Pleasurable people and things make life easier for lizardfolk. Pleasurable things should be preserved and protected, sometimes at the cost of the lizardfolk’s own safety. The most pleasurable creatures and things are ones that allow lizardfolk to assess more situations as benign rather than fearsome. Cold and Calculating Most humanoids describe cold-blooded people as lacking in emotion and empathy. The same label serves as an apt depiction of lizardfolk. Lacking any internal emotional reactions, lizardfolk behave in a distant manner. They don’t mourn fallen comrades or rage against their enemies. They simply observe and react as a situation warrants. Lizardfolk lack meaningful emotional ties to the past. They assess situations based on their current and future utility and importance. Nowhere does this come through as strongly as when lizardfolk deal with the dead. To a lizardfolk, a comrade who dies becomes a potential source of food. That companion might have once been a warrior or hunter, but now the body is just freshly killed meat. A lizardfolk who lives among other humanoids can, over time, learn to respect other creatures’ emotions. The lizardfolk doesn’t share those feelings, but instead assesses them in the same clinical manner. Yes, the fallen dwarf might be most useful as a meal, but hacking the body into steaks provokes aggression in the other humanoids and makes them less helpful in battle. Utility and Survival The lizardfolk mindset might seem unnecessarily cruel, but it helps them survive in a hostile environment. The swamps they inhabit are filled with a staggering variety of threats. Lizardfolk focus on survival above all, without sentiment. Lizardfolk assess everyone and everything in terms of utility. Art and beauty have little meaning for them. A sharp sword serves a useful and good purpose, while a dull sword is a dead weight without a whetstone. Lizardfolk see little need to plan more than a season or so into the future. This approach allows them to maintain their current level of influence in the world, but it limits their growth. Lizardfolk have no interest in developing writing, making long-term plans, or cultivating other methods to progress beyond their simple existence as hunters and gatherers. Hapless Soft Ones At their core, lizardfolk view other humanoids with an indifference verging on pity. Born into the world lacking stout scales and sharp teeth, it’s a wonder they have managed to survive for so long. The typical human would barely make it through a day in the swamps. Still, if other creatures prove useful to lizardfolk, those creatures can trigger a protective response made all the stronger by their apparent weakness. The lizardfolk assess such beings as hatchlings, young ones incapable of protecting themselves but who might prove useful in the future if they receive care. Lizardfolk Personality You can use the Lizardfolk Quirks table to determine a personality quirk for a lizardfolk character or to inspire a unique mannerism. Lizardfolk Quirks d8 Quirk 1 You hate waste and see no reason not to scavenge fallen enemies. Fingers are tasty and portable! 2 You sleep best while mostly submerged in water. 3 Money is meaningless to you. 4 You think there are only two species of humanoid: lizardfolk and meat. 5 You have learned to laugh. You use this talent in response to all emotional situations, to better fit in with your comrades. 6 You still don’t understand how metaphors work. That doesn’t stop you from using them at every opportunity. 7 You appreciate the soft humanoids who realize they need chain mail and swords to match the gifts you were born with. 8 You enjoy eating your food while it’s still wriggling. Lizardfolk Names Lizardfolk take their names from the Draconic language. They use simple descriptives granted by the tribe based on an individual’s notable deeds or actions. For example, Garurt translates as “axe,” a name given to a lizardfolk warrior who defeated an orc and claimed his foe’s weapon. A lizardfolk who likes to hide in a stand of reeds before ambushing an animal might be called Achuak, which means “green” to describe how she blends into the foliage. Lizardfolk make no distinction between male and female in their naming conventions. Each example name includes its translation in parenthesis.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Random Height and Weight You may roll for your character’s height and weight.

Base Height Base Weight Height Modifier Weight Modifier 4'9\" 120 lb. +2d10 × (2d6) lb. Lizardfolk Speech Lizardfolk can master Common, but their mindset results in a speech pattern distinct from other humanoids. Lizardfolk rarely use metaphors. Their speech is almost always literal. They might pick up idioms, but only with some difficulty. Names confuse them, unless they are descriptive. They tend to apply their own naming conventions to other creatures using Common words. Lizardfolk use active verbs to describe the world. A lizardfolk in cold weather might say, “This wind brings cold” rather than “I feel cold.” Lizardfolk tend to define things in terms of actions, rather than effects.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Volo's Guide to Monsters"},{"name":"Lizardfolk","description":"The saurian lizardfolk are thought by some sages to be distant cousins of dragonborn and kobolds.

Stuff of nightmares, this kid.” - Grenkogg the Barricade, Barbarian Adventurer Creatures of swamp, river, and lake, these salamander-kin go with the flow—literally. Where the water wends, lotol (LOT-ol) make their home. Despite their shorter lives, lotol rarely rush; they have little to prove and trust in the currents of fate to take them where they need to be. Masters of adaptation, it is the lotol’s propensity to find joy in all things that sets them apart from other races: the croak of a bullfrog, the death of an elder, or the sweet scent of petrichor after a long hot summer; all are accepted with an open, wholesome grace. Lizard Legend In lotol legend, the first lotol ancestor, Ablon the Stoney, had magnificently hard scales but was a stoic and unfeeling creature. To teach him a lesson, the great Platinum Dragon cursed him to be more sensitive. Ablon’s scales fell from his body, and his kin would forever bear this soft-skinned nature as a reminder to always be aware of how your actions might affect the world around you. In their own tongue, lotol are known as the ‘lizards without scales’. Consequently, lotol often remark when they meet humanoids that do have scales, such as dragonborn, lizardfolk, or golynn. This reaction varies, from awe to envy, or from open infatuation to a fearful expectation of insensitivity or brutishness (stereotypes some lotol individuals hold). A sect of lotol, The Platinum Apology, dedicate their lives to ending this curse and restoring themselves as scale-wearing reptiles. Whether or not this curse is real, let alone possible, is unknown. Water Waders The few times lotol ever come into conflict with neighbours, it is almost always to do with water. A growing lotol population creates new wetlands by damming up rivers, sometimes to the chagrin of local trappers and woodsfolk. Following floods, whole pods of lotol can find themselves washed downstream into an entirely new (and often recently-drowned) habitat. Fortunately for those that may be reconstructing their lives following such an inundation, lotol are more than keen to help. Lotol with innate aqueous adaptations can prove a blessing to washed-out villages and offset the enmity villagers may feel towards this newly-arrived population of semi-nomadic salamander-folk. With their supple, permeable skin, lotol are extremely sensitive to pollutants. If a black dragon poisons the water upstream or heavy metals from a dwarven mine begin to leech into the groundwater, lotol are often the first to know. The only record of lotol going to war is recorded in the oral chant The Cleansing Tide . With the help of a bronze dragon, Chionthan the Forgetful, lotol of the Chion Valley snuck upon the cruel and pernicious Ulvik the Black. There they delivered a mighty electric current into his lair, causing him to flee in fear. Lotol believe that their ability to generate electric currents through their skin is a blessing from the great Chionthan. Adaptive and Atypical To call lotol adaptive is an understatement. When required, lotol can change their very physiology, growing gills, improving their eyesight, or even developing long, elastic tongues. Adapting quickly to different environments allows them to explore a gamut of potential habitats, despite their sensitive skin. Some lotol even embark on quests, seeking to put themselves in the most unusual and atypical situations imaginable in order to unlock as-yet-undiscovered adaptations. Lotol Traits As a lotol, you have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age . Newborn lotol metamorphose into their adult form in 1 year and reach full maturity after 10 years. They typically live between 40 and 50 years. Languages .

Your mind is a simple place, the influence of outside forces washing over it like crashing waves over smooth sea glass. You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws . Slippery Skin . You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid or end the grappled or restrained conditions on yourself. Adaptive Polymorphism . Each lotol’s lineage is unique, and certain traits follow clans or families, or mutate by chance in individuals. Choose two of the following adaptations. When you gain a level, you can choose to replace one of these adaptations with another when you finish your next long rest. Aqueous Adaptation . You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and can breathe underwater. Gecko Cling. You gain a climbing speed of 20 feet and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to maintain grapples and prevent yourself from being disarmed of an object you are holding. Darkvision . Accustomed to life in the murky underbrush, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey. Prehensile Tongue. Your long, extendable tongue can be used to grab Tiny objects out of arm’s reach. As a bonus action, you can use your tongue to grab a Tiny object within 20 feet of you.

They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. If provoked to action, loxodons are true terrors—bellowing with rage, trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their serene wisdom, fierce loyalty, and unwavering conviction are tremendous assets to their guilds. Lumbering Giants Loxodons tower above most other humanoids, standing over 7 feet tall. They have the heads—trunks, tusks, ears, and faces—of elephants, and hulking bipedal bodies covered by thick, leathery skin. Each of their hands has four thick digits, and their feet are the flat-bottomed, oval-shaped feet of elephants. Like that of an elephant, a loxodon’s trunk is a useful appendage. In addition to providing a keen sense of smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy objects. The trunk can be used to carry both food and liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel. Gifted Stoneworkers Loxodons are tireless, patient artisans with an unrivaled intuition about their craft. Although they make nurturing spiritual leaders, their gift for stonework is so ingrained that they are often at a loss when they try to impart that knowledge to others. Among the Selesnya , it primarily falls to loxodons to build the guild’s magnificent, cathedral-like arboretum structures. Relentlessly Loyal Loxodons believe in the value of community and life, and thus are most often found in the Selesnya Conclave. Some find fulfillment in the cause of order by joining the Orzhov Syndicate or the Azorius Senate. Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, loxodons devote themselves to maintaining that bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They expect reciprocal loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed. The primary difference between loxodons who join different guilds is their sense of the size of the community they belong to. For loxodons in the Selesnya Conclave , their community is the world and all living beings in it—everything valuable, meant to live in harmony, and interdependent. For Azorius loxodons, community primarily means a society of different peoples who need adherence to law and order so they can function together. For those in the Orzhov Syndicate , community means the syndicate alone, with its interests taking priority over those of any other group. Loxodon Names A loxodon’s name includes subtle tones, produced in a loxodon’s resonant nasal chambers, that indicate status, family connection, and community role. Since most non-loxodons can’t distinguish these underlying tones, let alone produce them, loxodons often translate them into titles, such as Hierarch, Revered, Grandmother, Healer, or Saint, when interacting with other races.

They also tend toward good. Size. Loxodons stand between 7 and 8 feet tall. Their massive bodies weigh between 300 and 400 pounds. Your size is Medium. Powerful Build.

They are as often shunned for their eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colors, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role. Touched To most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and distracted, which has lead to a belief that they are of low intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot. These inherent talents, sometimes dismissed as luck, can be improved upon with training and study. Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood. Of Two Worlds While most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships among families and friends. Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in larger cities. Lumas tend to keep to themselves, preferring the company of those who understand them rather than those who pass judgement. Luma Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Lumas are short-lived reaching adulthood around 20 years. Few lumas live beyond 70 years. Alignment. Spurred by personal interests and flights of fancy, lumas lean towards chaotic alignments. While generally good natured, those that have been spurned by society find it hard to see the benefits of altruism, but even under such circumstances lumas are rarely evil. Size. Lumas are the shortest and lightest of the birdfolk, standing roughly 3 feet tall and weighing only around 30 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Glide. Using your feathered arms, you can slow your fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose, although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you are encumbered. Wing Flap. As a bonus action, you can use your powerful feathered arms to propel yourself upward a distance equal to half your movement speed.

Former subjects of Lucifuge, they proclaimed the Great Refusal and left Inferno to walk out in the open under the sun and stars again. With the end of their infernal service, they lost many of their previous supernatural powers and most of their inhuman traits, becoming almost-ordinary humans, barely marked by minor beast-like peculiarities and instincts. Even their memories from before they left the underworld and their knowledge of an eternity of damnation are like hazy dreams; the moment of their Great Refusal is a sort of rebirth into the earthly world, where they themselves choose the mortal form in which they will incarnate. “Thence we came forth to rebehold the stables.\" - Durante Alamozza, Malebranche, leaving Inferno - The first to rebel, centuries ago, was the legendary Diavolmanno, the “Great Human Devil”, who later found work as a circus attraction. Since then, several hundred among the damned have followed his example. The Great Beast looks with hatred upon the “twice-rebels” who turned against him… but let’s face it, the Great Beast tends to look at everyone like that, so who gives a damn? Fun Nicknames: jollygoods, goats, hornies, poor devils. Typical Names: Draghignazzo, Frosthoar, Uggelimutt, Wildehogge, Rubicante, Slovenlislobbe, Craniumsmasher, Giudittah. They often use nicknames and stage names. How Other Races See Them Although they have roamed the Kingdom for a while, malebranche are still regarded with great distrust because of their nature, appearance, and origin. After all, they are foreigners, they come from afar, their faces are ugly, and their ways bizarre, they’re often vulgar and foul-mouthed, and have no respect for local customs and beliefs: these are all things that don’t go down well with guards, bigots, and the hoi polloi. The latter do tend to have this reaction, even with people from neighboring villages, so who gives a damn. Strangely enough, priests, monks, and the faithful of the Calendar are not hostile toward malebranche, but rather consider them a worthy example of redemption. Their very existence and the fact that they brought about the Great Refusal proves on the one hand that Inferno exists and is a nasty place, and on the other that anyone can give it a wide berth if they follow the Creed and teachings of the Saints. Malebranche Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Malebranche \"are born\" again on earth on the day of their Great Refusal. No matter what appearance they used to have up to that moment, they incarnate in a body with a physiology very similar to humans, albeit they present bestial features, and generally in the form of adults. From that moment on, they age as a human or a gifted. Size. Malebranche are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Brawl Feature: Hellbrawl. Trained in the darkest caves of the Malebolge, the malebranche have learned the unholy art of the Hellbrawl that has made them relentless and tireless fighters. You have advantage on all saving throws made during a brawl. Infernal Helltraits. Malebranche are different from each other and display particular traits called Helltraits due to their infernal heritage. Your malebranche character has two of the following Infernal Helltraits: Hellwings. You have small wings, too small to allow flight, but sufficient to glide. If you are able to use the wings while falling, you take no falling damage. Hellflames. When you use your Hellflames weapon, each creature in a 15-foot cone, or in a 5-foot wide, 30-footlong line, must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level. After you use your Hellflames weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest. Hellfeet. You have sturdy and snappy goat legs with hooves. Your base walking speed increases to 40 feet. Hellvoice. You can cast the charm person spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Hellclaws. Your hands have grown mighty claws. You have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Hellears. Pointed and feral ears give you incredible hearing, capable of catching even the cries of the most distant damned. You gain proficiency in the Perception skill and you add double your proficiency bonus to any Perception check that requires hearing.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Acheron Games","book":"Brancalonia - Core Rulebook Compendium"},{"name":"Mandrake","description":"It was an ancient thing of moss-covered wood which creaked like a greatoak as it breathed, but I’ll never forget its eyes: those glowing points were a thing of the fey, a thing of the deep woods forgotten to man. —Faizon the Blue, encountering a mandrake Laymen believe that mandrakes are wailing babies grown from the roots of a plant. However, such mandrakes are those which are harvested too early; literally children still in infancy. If allowed to grow for a year and a day before being harvested, mandrakes can mature into great and powerful tree people. Mandrakes mature in a decade and live for centuries, growing wider and more gnarled with bark as they age. Flesh from Wood With a skin of thick bark and leaves growing at their extremities, you could be forgiven for believing that mandrakes are simply bizarre plants, treants, or animated trees. This might even be partially true: it seems that while mandrakes originated from some plant ancestor, they have become something midway between animal and plant through strange magic or stranger evolution. Mandrake anatomies are filled with paradoxes. They bleed a ruby ichor, reminiscent of both blood and sap. Their hearts, which look like a knot of roots, pump this around their body, enriching it with oxygen borne by leaves and special pores on their extremities. By preference, mandrakes can bask in the sunlight or consume living things for nourishment, and can even absorb nutrients through their feet, though they rarely subsist by sunlight and water alone. Forest Envoys Alchemists and arcanists alike scratch their heads at mandrakes, but druids know them as the green emissaries who stand between the realms of animals and plants, making peace for all parties. To druidic tradition, mandrakes are unique, ancient constructions of Mother Nature herself, intended to act as delegates of her will. Mandrakes are credited by old druids for aligning elves with the forests and dwarves with the mountains; only with the rising tide of humanoids and their preponderance of gods did most creatures forget about Mother Nature and her half-plant ambassadors. Today, mandrakes are rare, and make their homes in the forests near where villages and cities meet the true wilds. Humans tell tales of mandrakes savaging those who enter their domain, but druids and those who respect the old traditions of the forest know that such ire is seldom undeserved. Mandrake Traits Because you are neither beast nor plant, you have the following characteristics: Ability Score Increase. Increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Typical: Constitution +1, Wisdom +2 Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. However, spells and effects that specifically affect Plants affect you as well. Size. You are Medium. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Plant Nature. Even though you are not fully a plant, you still possess many of the same traits as one. As long as you are in direct sunlight for at least 4 hours a day, you don’t need to eat. Additionally, you can breathe through your leaves and extremities and you can absorb water and nutrients through your feet. Emissary of the Trees. You are proficient in the Nature skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks you make to interact with Beasts and Plants. Root Magic. You know the shillelagh cantrip and can target yourself with the spell, treating one of your limbs as a club for the duration of the spell. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the goodberry spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Starting at 5th level, you can cast the barkskin spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast goodberry or barkskin with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose one when you select this race). Entangling Vines. You can use your bonus action to cause grasping weeds and vines to sprout up from the ground around a Large or smaller creature you can see within 30 feet. Until the end of the creature’s next turn, its speed becomes 0 and can’t increase. This effect ends early if the creature takes the Disengage action. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you reach 3rd level, your Entangling Vines gain an additional effect based on the season in which you were harvested (choose when you select this race): Spring. Your Entangling Vines can target an airborne creature within 30 feet of the ground, which is pulled safely to the ground when you use this trait. Summer. Your Entangling Vines can move the target up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space on the ground or on a floor. Autumn.

The target takes cold damage equal to your proficiency bonus.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Mage Hand Press","book":"Valda's Spire of Secrets"},{"name":"Manikin","description":"With a touch of gold, a breath of lightning, and hours of meticulous welding and articulation, a manikin is ‘born’. Often called ‘marionettes’ or ‘living dolls’, these creatures were originally the creations of the Scions, a Luyarnhian sect who seek to craft a force capable of protecting the city. Though each manikin looks different—indeed, they can resemble any race—the thin golden stitching that joins the plates of their artificial skin is a giveaway that the creature is a man-made creation. Free Will. Inscribed on human eyes inside their skulls are the instructions which all manikin obey. More often than not, this includes a safety system that ensures adherence to the law and prevents a manikin turning on their master. In some cases, a crafter might even cause the manikin to feel love for their creator. Conceived as animate objects capable of carrying out the instructions, manikin who express thoughts of self-liberation are often disposed of before these thoughts turn into acts. Though the Scions intentions were initially noble, playing god has given them a taste for power and they have no intention of granting free will to their animated servants. Manikin Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age. As they are not alive, Manikins do not age. However, their materials slowly lose their magic essence over time, meaning they will ultimately lose control over their entire body and turn back into inanimate objects. Creature Type.

This lapse in judgment affects you in all circumstances. You have disadvantage on Insight checks. Lightning Heart. You have resistance to lightning damage. Living Material. Manikins don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe and are immune to the poisoned condition. In addition, their metallic mind is incorruptible, they have advantage on saving throws against madness.

You gain no AC benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you apply its bonus as normal.

They are crafty, hearty, and tough, but their true strength lies in the potential they see when looking at the world around them. Mapachs have incredibly light hands and a great degree of fine motor control that doesn’t diminish with age. They are also adept at climbing and sneaking. This, combined with their love of trinkets, has earned them an undeserved reputation as thieves. While there are exceptions, most mapachs are quite good-natured, if a little eccentric. Resilient Opportunists Mapachs are adept at surviving tough woodland conditions, and at intuiting the right course of action when faced with a problem. They are also inveterate opportunists. Some may consider them brash, but mapachs know that opportunities rarely present themselves and are quick to act on them. Mapachs are alert and have a keen awareness of their surroundings. Only the truly foolhardy among them are taken in by obvious traps. Canny Craftspeople One of the traits mapachs are most well-known for is their ability to find a use for just about anything. This knack for creating functional or useful items out of debris, junk, or on-hand materials is known as “scroungecraft”, and is a cultural staple among mapachs. This activity is considered an art form among mapachs, on par with the high art of other peoples. Scroungecrafting demonstrates creativity, ingenuity, and resourcefulness, but is misunderstood by outsiders who see it as primitive or crude. Genius ideas created by mapach hands frequently began as scroungecraft prototypes. Many who have built such interesting or unique creations achieve celebrity status among mapachs, going on to showcase their skills in loosely-organized scroungecraft fairs. Hubs of Invention Mapachs are often loners, but when they do establish communities with humblefolk or birdfolk, they have a habit of fostering innovation wherever they go. Mapach ingenuity was responsible for the contraption upon which Alderheart’s pulley system was based. The pulley system was so successful that birdfolk perches beyond Alderheart have adopted the technology. Mapach Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age. Mapachs mature quickly, reaching adulthood around 8 years. Despite this they have fairly average lifespans, the oldest among them living just past 60 years. Alignment. Mapachs don’t favor good over evil, with most choosing to remain neutral. They also lean towards the freedom of chaotic alignments. Size. Mapachs stand between 4 and 5 feet tall, and encompass a variety of builds from svelt to wide, weighing between 90 and 160 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Mapachs are most comfortable under the cloak of night. Expert Climbers. You have a climb speed of 20 feet. Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage. Scroungecraft. You are proficient with tinker’s tools. Additionally, you have the ability to construct crude but functional versions of common items using materials present in your surroundings. You may spend 10 minutes to craft these materials into any tool or piece of adventuring gear worth 30 gold pieces or less. The item will be completely functional, even capable of passing for a disguise (if you crafted an article of clothing). Tools, along with any other item that would logically break on its first use (caltrops, arrows), will become useless afterward. Scroungecrafted items will otherwise last 1 hour before falling apart. Depending on the materials available, a Game Master (GM) may rule that you cannot craft an item in this way. For example, a vial of acid might be easy to make if you happen to be near a nest of acidic beetle larvae, or bark can be bound into a makeshift flask, but it would be difficult to create a passable facsimile of silken robes from a pile of leaves. Should you have access to the proper materials, you can spend 8 hours converting an item you have scroungecrafted in this way into a permanent version, so long as you start this process before the item falls apart. Items crafted in such a way will function exactly as a normal version of the item, and if you have proficiency in the tools used to craft them, they can even look professionally-crafted. Otherwise, they retain a rather rough, cobbled-together appearance.You can also use scroungecraft to repair broken equipment, provided you have the materials on hand. Though, how long your repairs hold together is up to the GM. Skulker. You have advantage on Stealth checks made in dim light and darkness. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk and Mapach.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Hit Point Press","book":"Humblewood"},{"name":"Marionette","description":"In bygone times, marionettes were extraordinarily rare, but in recent centuries their presence has become increasingly common in the Kingdom’s cities, theaters, and companies, along with that of marottes and other artifact creatures made of triflewood, aka “turquoise wood”. Once grown exclusively in the most remote recesses of the town of Cuccaigne and impossible to find, this material is now being cultivated in various places around the Kingdom – with the turquoises’ authorization – and more freely exploited. Due to the rarity of this wood, marionettes are usually of “classic” child-like size, and of humanoid features, but assorted experiments and variations are occasionally tried. Marionettes look like entirely artificial creatures of burnished wood, with joints, painted parts, and mechanical elements, and would be totally inert without the powerful Extravaganza that animates them. Their features can be those of a child, adult or elderly, male or female person, of different ethnicities and shapes. In any case, their true nature soon emerges and – by varying degrees and more or less spontaneously – they reach their ideal inner form. The triflewood nucleus generally corresponds to the heart and head of the marionette, and its removal or destruction is as lethal as similar maiming in a human being. In the past, as a reward for jobs and tasks or to end the suffering and humiliations of a lifetime, famous marionettes asked and obtained leave from the turquoises to become real human beings. These days, in a world that has learned to accept them for what they are, marionettes are often happy to be themselves. Fun Nicknames: puppets, woodguts, paintedasses, peewees. Actually, even the more common nickname “marionette” is inaccurate, and supporters of the Movement for the Rights of Wooden People use the latter as their official connotation. Typical Names: Cinnamon, Greenbean, Giopi, Gnappus, Medlar, Hazelnut, Elm, Ricoletto, Triboletto, Zammariah. As they do not breed like humans, the few marionette “families” rarely use surnames. Their most ancient, famous, and powerful “dynasty” is that of the Cherries, celebrated puppeteers in their own right. \"And he had made a trumpet of his ass.\" - Unknown Supreme Poet - How Other Races See Them Among the Kingdom’s common inhabitants, marionettes compete with the nonexistents for the “Funniest Being” distinction, even surpassing the malebranche and talking animals. In the old days, people viewed marionettes as feys and miraculous beings, but for some decades now they have grown accustomed to their still-exceptional but no longer inconceivable presence. The fact that they are generally employed as entertainers, actors, and musicians has brought marionettes widespread acceptance in towns and villages, while also rendering them a bad service: most commoners see them as buffoons and jesters, and find it hard to recognize them as real people. In the course of their lives, regardless of their mood or the type of performance they happen to be engaged in, marionettes will be heckled with “Make us laugh, puppet,” and similar humiliations over and over again. Marionette Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity and Constitution scores increase by 1. Age. The marionettes \"are born\" at the time of manufacture, and their age is represented by the features that the carpenter gives them, usually adolescent or adult. Their nature is both resistant and fragile, and they age and deteriorate along with the wood they are made of. The triflewood begins to deteriorate after a few decades and rarely exceeds half a century. Size. Marionettes average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Triflewood Construct. You are an animated construct and you have the following benefits: You are immune to poison and have immunity to the poisoned condition. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe. You are immune to disease (except for wood diseases). Magical but Still Made of Wood. You have vulnerability to fire damage. Self Mending. As long as your triflewood core is not destroyed, you are able to repair yourself with ease, adding 2d8 to the maximum number of Hit Dice you can spend at the end of a short rest. You regain this trait’s spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. Brawl Feature: Removable Limb. As a bonus action during a brawl, you can detach a limb and use it as a common prop. Unlike normal common props, your limb is not lost after use. Different Shapes (Subrace) Although the most common marionette is the pinocchio, there are other shapes of marionettes. Choose one of these subraces. Pinocchio One of the oldest and certainly the most widespread shapes, conceived mainly as a performer and actor in trav- eling theater troupes. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1. Gullible. You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks. Pupo The most typical zagarian puppets have been created by mimicking the ancient paladins' distinctive appearance and attitudes, and they are generally quite belligerent. This shape is made with parts of brass armor grafted directly into its wood, which therefore become part of its very nature. Integrated Armor. You get no benefit from wearing armor but you can still benefit from the bonus offered by a shield. Your AC is equal to 12 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2) + your proficiency bonus.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Acheron Games","book":"Brancalonia - Core Rulebook Compendium"},{"name":"Marionette Geppettin","description":"“As soon as he reached home, Geppetto took his tools and began to cut and shape the wood into a Marionette.” —Carlo Collodi, Le Avventure di Pinocchio Ever a joy to children, geppettin resemble living playthings made of wood, cloth, or porcelain. Though easily mistaken for puppets, geppettin aren’t manipulated by a just-out-of-sight puppeteer; they are animated, sentient, and independent. Living Toys As a race, the geppettin are an oddity. Though rare, they are numerous enough and share enough similarities that they may be counted as an actual race of people, and not merely freak mishaps of magic. While there might be dedicated creators of geppettin, as there are with golems, many geppettin come to life on their own. Physically, geppettin are often shorter than halflings. Their physical features vary greatly from type to type, but they are almost always humanoid in shape. For simplicity, geppettin are classified by their materials: bisque are porcelain, marionettes are wood, and plushies are made of fabric. Despite being made of somewhat flimsy materials, sentience grants them an odd hardiness. Additionally, due to their non-living nature, they never hunger, rarely tire, and are adept at being innocuous. Most find some form of work or profession in entertainment, but a few find fantastic success as spies and assassins. As living constructs, geppettin don’t age, and are mature as soon as they become sentient. Marionette Traits Marionette geppettin are made mostly out of wood, with painted faces and carved clothing. Due to their construction, their jointed limbs are quite flexible, and they are known to be fantastic dancers.

While you are motionless, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary wooden doll. Clipped Strings.

Very few understand their antiquated tribal customs and myth-laden practices. Their only known lineage hails from the enigmatic nature of the bahtera. Though honor-bound by their own internal code, they are also highly reclusive, which makes me wonder how deep the internal struggles lie between their peoples. ” — Valara Drake, promethean commander For over a thousand years, the major races of the Silrayne Arc have explored the primordial energies that form the universe and the delicate balance that binds them together as a whole. Bahtera, hybrid beasts formed from matter and energy, walk between these two cosmic realities and evolve by adapting the matter of other species into their own bodies. During one such period of evolution, a new species was born, an offshoot carrying the exotic traits of their mercurial ancestors. This race of creatures became known as the matokai. Children of the Elements Matokai are primarily a race of humanoid lizards, but they also inherit a dual nature, one that binds them to a particular source of primordial energy. They have distinct builds, skin textures, and colors that define their lineage. Their connection to these energies can often manifest in the form of innate talents or resistances depending on their sub-type. Physically, the matokai vary greatly in height, ranging anywhere from 5 feet to almost 7 feet. They have elongated snouts with sharp fangs. The majority of their bodies are covered in fine scales that vary in color between shades of blue, gold, red, or white. Their hands and feet bear sharp claws, with three fingers and a thumb on each hand. They possess no hair, but can have different variations of fins or small spikes that run from the tops of their heads down over their spine. While the matokai are descended from the bahtera, they are very far removed from these creatures, who view the matokai to be abominations and a misstep in the evolutionary process. While they don’t bear immediate hostilities, the bahtera and matokai have extremely strained relations, with the only thing shared in common being their form of communication. Duty and Honor Matokai society is heavily focused on position and steeped in codes of honor and tradition. They believe themselves to be directly linked to spirits that reside within the energies of the galaxy, guiding all things toward an eventual destiny. Their homeworld, Bas Drasku, is overseen by a number of provincial governments and presided over by five monarchs—an imperial ruler and one head representative for each matokai sub-type. Each of these has a hierarchy of military and clan leaders that hold rank based on their popularity and respect of the people. Honor, self-worth, and loyalty to one’s clan all play an important part in the daily lives of the matokai and this can seen in different forms in those who venture off to other worlds. Matokai who are found in different cultures still hold their own strict code of ethics and a desire for self-improvement. Though this attitude can provide positive reinforcement, it can sometimes goad them into taking unnecessary risks to avoid the shame of failure or embarrassment. Reach of the People The matokai have established colonies throughout most of the Silrayne Arc. It is rare to travel into a major star system and not find a space station or planetary settlement built by the matokai. The reasoning behind this galactic expansion is two-fold. They wish to be represented in all matters that may involve their people, as well as establish close relations with each of their neighboring allies. Matokai Names A matokai has a given name and a clan name. When introducing themselves, their clan name is presented first. After their lineage has been established, it is common for others to simply use the matokai’s given name on its own whenever referring to them. Male Names: Ajarax, Balamor, Craxar, Druval, Eltor, Getrin, Heshrak, Krel, Margon, Nathkar, Prakund, Rhortak, Strazku, Toruun, Velkyth Female Names: Akuske, Biridu, Dilar, Fareh, Havoshi, Johralu, Kaiann, Kohra, Mishiki, Nalka, Rageri, Sursuke, Tagasa, Uronka, Vatale Clan Names: Bargatul, Chataka, Girolei, Krathta, Linayako, Nekrimat, Qugiri, Sylori, Tojoru, Wamarei Matokai Traits Your matokai character has certain traits in common with all other matokai. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution increases by 2. Age. Matokai age and mature at the same rate as humans. They lifespans are slightly longer, living to around 150. Alignment. Matokai tend to be lawful or neutral, but their personal code of ethics can vary greatly between selfishness and selflessness. Though they usually lean toward good, evil matokai are far from uncommon. Size. A matokai’s height can vary greatly, being anywhere between 5 feet to a little over 7 feet tall. All matokai, regardless of height, are a little bulkier in build than most humanoids. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Languages. You speak, read, and write Common, Matokai, and Bahtera. Bahtera is a combination of gestures and deep, often guttural sounds. Claws. Your claws are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Subraces. Each matokai comes from one of four different subraces, known to them as sub-types.

To aid him in his duty, the Fortune of Death maintains a large staff, including servants, judges, scribes, guards, bailiffs, and all manner of administrators. Most of the mazoku servants and administrators hope to earn a better reincarnation by serving the Fortune of Death loyally, though there are some who revel in holding such power over others. Mazoku Physiology Mazoku are dreadful beings that seem to tower over others in their presence, even if they happen to be physically shorter. In their true form, most are humanoid in shape, and they range in size from a few feet tall to well over ten feet. Many have brilliant blue or red skin, fangs, claws, and terrifying eyes. Each mazoku is relatively unique. When traveling in the Mortal Realm, however, mazoku are required by various celestial ordnances to take on mortal guise, meaning that their body is effectively human. They usually maintain one or more of their startling features in this form such as especially fearsome eyes, unusually sharp teeth, imposing eyebrows, or hair that tends to settle into a hornlike pattern. They can temporarily revert to their true form, but doing so takes a toll on their mortal shell. Perhaps more importantly, revealing themselves in front of mortals requires tremendous amounts of paperwork upon their return to the afterlife, so most mazoku try to avoid it at all costs. Cosmic Bureaucrats Mazoku are beings whose cosmic role is to mete out judgment and punishment to mortal souls. They inhabit the lower realms of the afterlife: the Realm of Waiting, the Realm of Hunger, the Realm of Slaughter, and parts of the deepest hell, the Realm of Torment, that have not been overrun by corrupted oni. Mazoku rarely come to the Mortal Realm, but when they do, it is usually in search of souls that have proved especially tricky to dislodge—those that even the loyal priests of the Fortune of Death have been unable to cast into the afterlife. Some mazoku view such assignments to the Mortal Realm as a welcome break, while others find it an insufferable punishment. Mazoku Traits As a mazoku, you benefit from the following: Ability Score Increase . Choose one ability score to increase by 2, and another to increase by 1. Age . Age has little meaning in the afterlife, but most mazoku are hundreds or thousands of years old. Size . Your mortal guise is of Medium size. Your true form is also of Medium size unless you select a Demonic True Form feature that changes it. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision . Mazoku need to be able to see even amidst the dark fires of the Realm of Torment, and so their eyesight is especially sharp in darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Demonic True Form . You can transform into your terrifying true form by spending a bonus action. When you are in your demonic form, you gain several beneficial features (see Demonic True Form Features ) and your creature type is fiend instead of humanoid. After a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus, you transform back. After you transform back, you cannot use this feature again until you complete a long rest. In any afterlife realm, you can transform to and from your true form at any time by spending a bonus action, and there is no limitation on how long you can stay in that form. Queue of the Dead . You are not alive, so you cannot die in the traditional sense. However, if you are killed (in any of the usual manners a PC could be), you vanish back to the Realm of Waiting, leaving only your items behind. There, you must wait until you get another assignment to visit the Mortal Realm (which can also take hundreds of years), and fill out any paperwork you incurred while in the Mortal Realm (which can take even longer). Barring exceptional circumstances, being killed removes you from the campaign just as it would any other PC. Language . See Backgrounds . Demonic True Form Features Select three different features from the list below. You benefit from these features only when you are in your demonic form. You cannot select a single feature more than once. Inured to an Element . When you select this feature, choose one of the following damage types: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder. You have resistance to the chosen damage type. Natural Weapons . You have horns, claws, a tail, or fangs that are capable of rending flesh as easily as a sword. When you select this feature, choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. Your unarmed strike profile uses a d8, deals the chosen damage type, and counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Inverted Weight . The world pulls on you differently, allowing you to leap great distances and walk on walls and even ceilings. Triple your jump distance. You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings while leaving your hands free. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Shroud of Souls . You are surrounded by buzzing insects, wailing spirits, or screeching bats. You have half cover even when standing in open ground, three-quarters cover when you would normally have half cover, and total cover when you would normally have three-quarters cover. Spiritual Force . You can invoke your authority over spirits of the dead, wielding their power as your own. When you transform into your demonic form, you immediately gain favor equal to your proficiency bonus. You can perform each of the following invocations once: commune with the spirits , divine the omens , threshold barrier . You cannot perform these invocations again this way until you complete a long rest. When you return to your mortal form, any unspent favor you gained this way is lost. Strange Physiology . You are much larger or smaller than your mortal form, and gain certain benefit from this shift in size. When you select this feature, choose Small or Large. You are the chosen size. If you choose Small, you gain a fly (hover) speed of 20 feet. If you choose Large, you have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. Swiftness of Death . In a blistering instant, you bear down upon your foe. When you transform into your demonic form, roll 1d8 and add your proficiency bonus. Starting the next round, your initiative value for the encounter is increased by this amount. When you return to your mortal form, your initiative returns to its original value. Terrifying Visage . Your countenance is extremely startling, especially to those who defy the Celestial Order. The first time each creature within 10 feet sees you in your demonic form each encounter, it must make a Wisdom saving throw with DC equal to 10 plus your proficiency bonus. On failure, it becomes frightened of you. Undead creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw, and must make it even if they have immunity to being frightened. Thick Hide . You are covered in scales, tough fur, or scarred hide. You gain resistance to slashing and piercing damage from nonmagical sources. Tireless Certainty . Your arrival is as certain as death, taxes, or paperwork. You do not suffer the negative effects of exhaustion and have advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws. Additionally, when you transform into your demonic form, you immediately gain temporary hit points equal to 2d6 plus your proficiency bonus.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Edge Studio","book":"Adventures in Rokugan"},{"name":"Medusa (Thylean)","description":"Medusa are humanoids that have made a bargain with dark powers to achieve beauty, eternal youth, great wealth, or some other mortal desire. As a consequence, their hair has been replaced with snakes, and their eyes have the power to petrify the unwary. They are despised and shunned by all other mortal races, and they must be careful to hide their identity when traveling in the civilized places of the world. Legend of the Medusa Thousands of years ago, a woman came to Thylea seeking her fortune. When the creatures of that land asked her from whence she came, she would only say, “I am from the land of the Gorgons.” In those days, Thylea was rich in natural beauty but poor in wealth. But the woman would not be deterred. First, the woman searched the steppes and mountains, and she came to the centaurs, asking, “Where may I find gems and jewels to rival the stars?” The centaurs offered her a shank of lamb and said, “Why seek gems and jewels when the stars are free to everyone?” Disappointed, she cast away the food and left the centaurs to their star-gazing. Then the woman searched the forests, and she came to the satyrs, asking, “Where may I find rivers of gold and silver that flow like fountains?” The satyrs offered her a goblet of wine and said, “Gold and silver make a very poor feast. Wouldn’t you rather join us for a song and a drink?” Disappointed again, the woman cast away the goblet and left the satyrs to their revelry. Now, the woman wandered high and low, seeking her fortune to no avail, and finally she came upon three women weaving at a loom. She said, “I wish for riches beyond the imagination of all the creatures that haunt this accursed land.” The three women, who were the Fates, warned her. “Is this truly what you desire? You may have it, but the price will be high.” And the woman answered, “When I am rich, I shall have no trouble paying any price.” And the Fates said, “So be it.” The woman’s eyes suddenly gleamed like golden coins, and wherever she turned her gaze, creatures were turned to stone. “So that none may rob you of your treasure,” said the Fates. The woman’s hair grew long and sinuous, slithering and scaled like snakes. “So that always you will have the company of hearts as cold as your own.” And finally, the woman’s hands were filled with gems and coins that were beautiful beyond the reckoning of stars or songs. Her name was Medusa, and she was the namesake of her curse, which afflicts many such mortals with more ambition than sense. Cursed by Dark Powers Medusae have typically made bargains with some sort of fiend or fiendish power, but in some cases, they are oathbreakers who have displeased the gods or the Fates. Either way, they have been afflicted with the curse of the medusa as punishment, and recovery from the curse is not possible without the use of powerful magic. In some cases, even the greater restoration spell may not be enough to break the curse. But in many other cases, the medusa simply embraces the curse as part of her identity. Children born to medusae are also affected by the curse. Ophidian Schemers Medusae are known to spend much of their time plotting against those who rival them in wealth, power, or beauty. Some medusae name their snakes and speak to them as if they were speaking to cherished pets or loved ones. Others are ashamed of their curse and seek to break it. Medusae must train themselves to never gaze into a mirror or stare at their reflection, for in an ironic twist of fate, they are vulnerable to their own petrifying gaze. Medusa Traits Medusae have the following traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1. Age . Medusae are not born—they are made. When a humanoid is afflicted by the curse of the medusa, they gradually transform into a snake-haired monstrosity. Once transformed, they may live for a thousand years, but most are hunted down and killed long before then. Alignment . Civilized medusae tend toward neutral or lawful evil alignments, because they must find ways to survive on the fringes of society. They must be careful to cooperate with others who will suffer the company of one who is cursed by the gods. Medusae who give into their anger eventually lose control of themselves and become true monsters. Size . Medusae are the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Languages . You can speak, read, and write Common and one language of your choice. Darkvision . Your eyes are adapted to dark places, giving you darkvision out to 60 ft. Cursed . You are afflicted by the curse of the medusa, but your transformation is already complete. Your curse can only be ended with the wish spell. If your curse ends, then your race changes to whichever race you were before you became cursed (usually a human). Snake Hair . You can attack with your snake hair. This is a melee weapon attack with an attack bonus equal to your proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier. It does 1d6 piercing damage on a hit, and your target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or else they are poisoned until the beginning of your next turn. Snake Blood . You have advantage on saving throws against spells and abilities that inflict the poisoned condition. Petrifying Gaze . Starting at 5th level, you can use your action to force a creature within 30 feet that can see your eyes to make a DC 8 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is paralyzed until the end of its next turn. On your turn, you can use your bonus action to force the same creature to repeat this saving throw with disadvantage. Each time it fails, it is paralyzed again until the end of its next turn. When a creature is paralyzed in this way for the third time in a span of 10 minutes, it is instantly petrified. Starting at 10th level, the DC for this saving throw increases to 10. At 15th level, the DC increases to 12. At 20th level, the DC increases to 14.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Arcanum Worlds","book":"Odyssey of the Dragonlords Compendium"},{"name":"Merfolk","description":"Merfolk are aquatic humanoids with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a fish. They are common throughout the oceans of the Forgotten Realms, and their settlements are as varied in colour, culture and outlook as the human races of the surface. Most merfolk communities are semi-nomadic, as the aquatic folk lack the skills to forge metal or carve stone. Instead, their settlements are founded in undersea caverns, coral mazes, and sunken cities. Many merfolk communities survive by trading with other undersea communities, such as tritons and sea elves. Because craft and trade is part of almost all merfolk cultures, these folk are renowned for their ability to barter with the best merchants of the realms.

It was then that I knew adventure was calling, and I instead had to follow my heart.” - Ul’pit Viperstrike of the Sandstone Clan, Midbari artisan Ne’Oor’s southern regions include many areas of desert and dry steppe, including the famous dunes of Dryloch. Despite the desert’s inhospitable environment, the Midbari people thrive here, mainly as nomads who travel in caravans in search of places with water and food. There are some Midbari tribes, however, who find or create oases, where they raise families in a village setting, living in yurts and camps built from found wood and animal skins, skillfully sewn together to create barriers against the sun and any predators. The Midbari face many natural threats: sandstorms, lack of water sources, and desert predators including scorpions, sandwyrms, and even dragons. However, through generations of desert living, they have a natural resilience to extreme heat. While there are Midbari of all skin colors and types, bronze skin and either sun-kissed or darker hair is most typical. Their eyes are large and set more closely than an average human’s eyes, giving the Midbari a genetic ability to see in extremely dim lighting and for farther distances. Their clothing is loose and light, both in material and color, adding layers at night when the desert sun fades and colder temperatures creep in. Headwear and wraps are worn to protect against the sun. Combined with their tribal clothing and veils worn to protect themselves from the sand, the Midbari are naturally able to withstand the hot temperatures in which they live quite well. Common Midbari foods include curds and other fermented milk products, dates, dried teas made from desert flowers, and grains, which they make into flatbreads cooked on hot stones, famous for their region.

It was then that I knew adventure was calling, and I instead had to follow my heart.” - Ul’pit Viperstrike of the Sandstone Clan, Midbari artisan Ne’Oor’s southern regions include many areas of desert and dry steppe, including the famous dunes of Dryloch. Despite the desert’s inhospitable environment, the Midbari people thrive here, mainly as nomads who travel in caravans in search of places with water and food. There are some Midbari tribes, however, who find or create oases, where they raise families in a village setting, living in yurts and camps built from found wood and animal skins, skillfully sewn together to create barriers against the sun and any predators. The Midbari face many natural threats: sandstorms, lack of water sources, and desert predators including scorpions, sandwyrms, and even dragons. However, through generations of desert living, they have a natural resilience to extreme heat. While there are Midbari of all skin colors and types, bronze skin and either sun-kissed or darker hair is most typical. Their eyes are large and set more closely than an average human’s eyes, giving the Midbari a genetic ability to see in extremely dim lighting and for farther distances. Their clothing is loose and light, both in material and color, adding layers at night when the desert sun fades and colder temperatures creep in. Headwear and wraps are worn to protect against the sun. Combined with their tribal clothing and veils worn to protect themselves from the sand, the Midbari are naturally able to withstand the hot temperatures in which they live quite well. Common Midbari foods include curds and other fermented milk products, dates, dried teas made from desert flowers, and grains, which they make into flatbreads cooked on hot stones, famous for their region. These breads, along with crafted goods such as rugs and textiles made from the wool of their herd animals, are used to trade with travelers that take the desert routes through southern Ne’Oor.

","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Renegade Game Studios","book":"Wardlings Campaign Guide"},{"name":"Minotaur","description":"Minotaur The minotaurs who dwell in the badlands of Phoberos and the remote polis of Skophos are caught between two worlds. Some follow the dark god Mogis, who has tyrannized them for ages untold and shown them a trail of slaughter that is all many minotaurs have ever known. Others, though, have emerged from this bloody path and found a world that welcomes those who pursue their own destinies and heroic callings. Built to Survive Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. Theros minotaurs often carve their horns to sharpen their edges, etch symbols of power into them, or sheathe them in bronze to prevent them from shattering during battle. Thick hair extends down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and some have long patches of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves, and they have long, tufted tails. Minotaur priests often adorn themselves with sacred items, be they trophies from fallen foes, keepsakes from their homeland, or naturally occurring marks of their god's favor. Ages of Darkness Although minotaurs aren't evil by nature and are free to worship any god, many are raised among those devoted to Mogis's vile whims. Myths tell that Mogis created the first minotaurs from his own followers, typically criminals and monsters of unspeakable depravity. While many groups of minotaurs still honor their villainous progenitors, others have abandoned their ancestors and moved beyond their crimes, seeking their fates in the future, not the past. While the inhabitants of Akros and other reaches near Phoberos, the homeland of most minotaur herds, have engaged in endless conflicts with bloodthirsty minotaurs, they know there are those who forsake Mogis's depravities. The people of Meletis, Setessa, and lands beyond are also generally open-minded and curious about minotaurs who wander into their lands. Epics like The Callapheia also describe multiple heroic minotaurs. As a result, a minotaur traveling in the company of other non-minotaurs is likely to be accepted in any polis. See chapter 3 for more details on Phoberos, the minotaur polis of Skophos, and various minotaur bands. Passion and Zeal Minotaurs are known for venting their outrage through violence, but they aren't generally quick to anger. They are passionate, loving their friends and partners fiercely, and they laugh loud and long at good jokes. This zeal also extends to their faith. Those who have avoided the corrupting influence of Mogis gravitate toward the service of gods who share their bold nature, especially Erebos, Keranos, and Purphoros. Those who have rejected Mogis sometimes embrace his hated twin brother, Iroas. Minotaur Names In the labyrinthine polis of Skophos, the deeds of minotaur champions are carved among the winding halls. Minotaurs often name their children after these great heroes, believing that a child will inherit the strength, audacity, guile, or fearsomeness of a heroic namesake. Other minotaur parents invent their own names, though, believing in their child's potential to light a new constellation in Nyx with the brightness of their own soul. The Minotaur Namesake table suggests possible qualities or deeds that a minotaur's namesake might have been known for. Your character might strive to emulate that quality or seek to forge a new legacy to be associated with your name by future generations. Female Names: Bozzri, Dhazdoro, Erinimachis, Ghalantzo, Halafoti, Kerania, Mitévra, Philoprodis, Tavromiki, Ypoudoris Male Names: Bamvros, Fotiyinos, Halafotios, Keranios, Menetavro, Nikavros, Prodos, Rhordon, Tavrostenes, Thyrogog Minotaur namesake d8 Ancestor’s Qualities 1 My namesake defeated a massive enemy. 2 My namesake was known for fierce devotion to a god. 3 My namesake was a respected leader of other warriors. 4 My namesake ran the entire breadth of Phoberos in order to warn the minotaurs of an Akroan attack. 5 My namesake was famous for great magical ability. 6 My namesake was a hero’s devoted companion. 7 My namesake is remembered for incredible generosity. 8 My namesake was a great oracle. Minotaur Traits Your minotaur character has the following racial traits. These traits are also suitable for minotaurs in other D&D worlds where these people have avoided the demonic influence of Baphomet. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age. Minotaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans. Alignment. Minotaurs who leave the walls of Skophos have the opportunity to be free of its culture and pursue chaotic alignments, while those who remain within the polis and its tyrannical regime tend toward lawful alignments. Size. Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have stocky builds. Your size is Medium. Here's how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier: Size modifier = 2d8 Height = 5 feet + 4 inches + your size modifier in inches Weight in pounds = 175 + (2d6 × your size modifier) Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Horns. Your horns are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Goring Rush. Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action. Hammering Horns. Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove that target with your horns. The target must be within 5 feet of you and no more than one size larger than you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, you push it up to 10 feet away from you. Imposing Presence. You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Intimidation or Persuasion. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Mythic Odysseys of Theros"},{"name":"Minotaur","description":"The minotaurs of Ravnica are strong in body, dedication, and courage. They are at home on the battlefield, willing to fight for their various causes. They combine a burning fury in battle with keen tactics that make them excellent commanders as well as valuable shock troops. Horns and Hooves Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. They often ornament their horns with metal rings or sheathe them in metal to protect them from damage. Manes of shaggy fur extend down minotaurs’ necks and powerful backs, and males have long tufts of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves. Minotaurs are born with long, tufted tails, but minotaurs of the Ordruun clan (and some others) have their tails docked as part of a coming-of-age ceremony; they find the heavy armor of the Boros legion much more comfortable without a long tail in the way. Strength and Zeal Minotaurs are zealous and love battle. They are found among the Gruul Clans , but the minotaurs of the Ordruun family line, long associated with the Boros Legion , are much better known and respected. Boros minotaurs choose the precision of the legion over the fury of the pack. Minotaurs tend to vent their outrage through violence, but they aren’t generally quick to anger. They are passionate, loving their friends and partners fiercely, and they laugh loud and long at good jokes. Family and Guild Minotaur legends describe a small pantheon of heroes—perhaps they were once thought of as gods—who established the minotaurs’ place in the world. Every minotaur in Ravnica claims descent from one of these heroes. The Ordruun line is the most prominent, with thousands of members descended from an ancient hero who is said to have taught minotaurs the arts of war. Other important family lines include the Kharran line (primarily associated with the Gruul Scab clan), the Drendaa line (found scattered among the Gruul Clans ), and the Tazgral line (divided between the Boros and the Gruul , with a significant number in the Rakdos as well). Since each family line has so many members, minotaurs don’t usually find it helpful to connect the name of the line to their personal names; even though Commander Grozdan of the Boros Legion’s Kamen Fortress is a prominent member of the Ordruun line, he would never call himself Grozdan Ordruun the way a human would. Minotaur Names The legends that recount the deeds of ancient minotaur heroes are full of other names as well: those of the retainers, allies, lovers, servants, enemies, and others who played roles, however small, in the lives of the heroes. Almost every minotaur name is drawn from that long list of minor characters of legend, so that those folk are never forgotten.

No matter how many children a minotaur has, odds are most of the males will have the same first name as their father and most of the females will have the same first name as their mother. The descriptors vary, but they’re aspirational rather than earned. Since the descriptors are given by the parents when the minotaur is still an infant, they might or might not turn out to be accurate. For example, parents who want their child to be a great warrior might call it “the Fierce.” If that minotaur grows up to become a poet rather than a warrior, it will still be called “the Fierce.” Male Names: Aewigr, Kamdoth, Korwyn, Krolm, Ordwar, Rankoth, Thargad, Theodar, Theonco, Vorkhul Female Names: Afridde, Brytredda, Chothuk, Gunda, Hrunan, Sedruse, Thariff, Thewenn, Varala, Wentheon Descriptors: the Brave, the Intimidating, the Mighty, the Never-Lost, the Reaver, the Swift, the Unstoppable, the Unyielding Minotaur Traits Your minotaur character has certain characteristics in common with all other minotaurs.

The bull-folk are imposing and powerful, with a well-earned reputation for ferocity that borders on monstrous. Today, the minotaurs exist in two groups, the intrepid bull-folk seeking to reclaim their ancestral cities of Cindass and Roshgazi, and Sudvall’s knights and warriors who balance chivalry with spirituality. Whether battling maze-born beasts, sailing upon sand-skiffs, or charging with a lance against a dinosaur, minotaurs bring their strength to bear on the Southlands. Physical Description As with their cousins in the North, the minotaurs of the Southlands are imposing and powerful, exhibiting many characteristics of the bulls they resemble. Both genders have horned heads covered with shaggy hair. Warriors braid their hair with teeth or other tokens of fallen enemies. The thick hair covering their bodies varies widely in color, from white to medium red-browns to dark brown and black. Many minotaurs shave or dye their fur in patterns signifying their allegiances and beliefs. Adult males can reach a height of 6 1/2 to 7 feet, with females averaging 3 inches shorter. Both genders have a great deal of muscle mass even for their considerable size, and physical prowess plays a large part in their social structure. Minotaurs can live as long as humans but reach adulthood three years earlier. Childhood ends around the age of 10 and adulthood is celebrated at 15. Young adult minotaurs often spend 10 years proving themselves to their elders. Minotaur Horns The most valued accessories of any minotaur are their horns. Grown by both sexes, horns display an individual’s status and strength, and they provide a ready weapon. Minotaurs honor their heritage by taking great care of their horns, polishing and shining them. Regardless of station or role in society, most bull-folk decorate their horns. They chronicle their achievements and victories with carvings, precious metals, jewels, or etchings on their horns. In Sudvall, minotaur knights often coat their horns in shining steel to mimic the lances they carry. Those who lose part or all of a horn suffer considerable stigma and must demonstrate their worth; the term “brokehorn” is a fighting insult. Some seek magical means to regrow their damaged horns, while others choose to keep a reminder of their failing. A brokehorn is one of Midgard’s most driven and dangerous creatures. The Ravening One ancient scourge stands above all the other threats to the bull-folk in the Southlands. The Ravening, a disease inducing madness and a lust for power gained through cannibalistic devouring of hearts, plagues a small portion of the bull-folk population. Some healers and sages speculate some aspect of the climate allows the disease to flourish, and at least one expedition out of Cindass seeks a magical source for the illness. The kijani seedlings of Sudvall offer a type of cure, but they are thousands of miles from the minotaurs of the Middle Sea. Regardless of location, most minotaurs fear the Ravening with good reason, as the disease regresses them into the monstrous beasts. Competitive Culture Minotaurs delight in competitions, proving their worth through deeds of strength or skill. These contests are seldom to the death; demonstrating superiority over a rival is enough. They believe defeat should not bring shame, only a renewed determination. The feudal culture of Sudvall factors in the minotaurs’ drive to compete, crafting their social schedule around a calendar of festivals and jousting tournaments. Twisting Paths and Labyrinth Magic Every minotaur settlement and structure of any size sports a twisting labyrinth of switchbacks and dead ends. While the Great Labyrinth in the capital city of Kyprion is the most renowned, Mazuli Sul, the “first labyrinth,” is the more infamous. This magically corrupted maze changes and grows like a living thing, sending tendrils of twisting corridors into the ruins of Roshgazi and beyond. The school of labyrinth magic belongs to the minotaurs. It includes elements of confusion, dimensional manipulation, and bolstering the bull-folk’s natural weapons. They seldom share this magic with other races. Minotaur Names Most minotaurs have two names. The first is almost always their father’s or mother’s name, or more distant kin for children after the first. While Northern bull-folk use descriptors given by family for their second name, Southland minotaurs scoff at such frivolity. Their deeds mark their glory and grant their second names, not some nickname given to an infant. Male Names: Aewigr, Krolm, Ordwar, Rankoth, Thargad, Vorkhul Female Names: Afridde, Chothuk, Gunda, Hrunan, Thewenn, Varala Minotaur Traits Your minotaur character has the following traits in common with other minotaurs. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age. Minotaurs mature at roughly the same rate as humans but mature 3 years earlier. Childhood ends around the age of 10 and adulthood is celebrated at 15. Alignment. Minotaurs possess a wide range of alignments, just as humans do. Mixing a love for personal freedom and respect for history and tradition, the majority of minotaurs fall into neutral alignments. Size. Adult males can reach a height of 6 1⁄2 to 7 feet, with females averaging 3 inches shorter. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Natural Attacks. You have proficiency with your horns, which deal 1d6 piercing damage. Charge. If you move at least 10 feet toward a target and hit it with a horn attack in the same turn, you deal an extra 1d6 piercing damage and you can shove the target as a bonus action. You can apply this extra damage once per turn. Starting at 11th level, when you successfully shove a creature with Charge, you can push it 10 feet instead of 5. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Labyrinth Sense. You can retrace without error any path you have previously taken, with no ability check. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Minotaur, as well as one other language of your choice (typically the Trade Tongue or Southern languages). Backgrounds. Minotaurs in the Southlands are natural survivors and commonly have the Guild Artisan, Outlander, Sailor, and Soldier backgrounds.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":11996},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Southlands Player's Guide"},{"name":"Minotaur (Thylean)","description":"Minotaurs are the descendants of an ancient tribe of humans who were cursed by the gods, transforming them into half-human, half-bull monstrosities. Although they are widely dismissed as unthinking brutes, they are in fact as diverse and as intelligent as any other race. Legend of the Minotaurs Over a thousand years ago, a tribe of humans washed ashore in Thylea and came to live in the southern hills of the Aresian peninsula. Here, they laid foundations for a city and called it Minos. But not one man or woman among them had the strength to till the hard, rocky soil. As fate would have it, they discovered a magnificent bull that could pull a plow through any terrain for days without resting. Using the bull’s great strength, they were able to produce bountiful crops with which to survive the first winter. Over time, the people of the tribe began to venerate the bull, crowning him as the god of the harvest. When Sydon learned of this, he was furious. He threw curses down upon the settlers and transformed them into bulls, in mockery of their insolence. Each of them was harnessed to a plow and forced to tread the same winding, geometric path, until that path became a deep, labyrinthian gorge. Eventually, the plows broke, and the people of Minos slowly began to stand upright again—but their faces had been forever changed by the curse. The people of the tribe came to be called minotaurs—the bulls of Minos—and they have never fully shed their bull-like demeanors. Some of them merely have horns and a snout-like nose, while others have the entire upper torso of a bull. Some continued to dwell in the labyrinth, while others left to explore the far reaches of Thylea. Over the centuries, they have come to view their own cursed existence as the will of the Fates. Warrior Bulls Minotaurs possess uncommon strength, making them excellent warriors. The curse infuses their bodies with the power of a bull at all times, and their muscles seldom relax, even when they are drunk or asleep. In battle, minotaurs sometimes lose control of their emotions and fly into a rage. When this happens, the curse takes over, transforming them back into a full-fledged bull for a short period of time. Oathbound Slaves Minotaurs are widely shunned, because they are believed to be unthinking brutes who have been cursed by the gods. Most minotaurs gather together to form small farming or fishing communities, far from civilization. The only way that most minotaurs can find work in cities and villages is to swear oaths of service that effectively reduce them to the status of slaves. Many bear this humiliation with stoic grit, but others resort to banditry rather than submit to the unreasonable demands of cowardly superstition. Minotaur Names Minotaurs generally prefer names that are short and simple. They typically punctuate their names with a snort or a sharp exhalation of air through their nostrils. When someone omits this part of their name, they become annoyed. Names : Arxan, Braz, Dregxa, Elagore, Garnox, Horus, Kath, Luth, Manx, Parth, Raxus, Steth, Torag, Zark Minotaur Traits Minotaurs have the following traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age . Minotaurs mature at the same rate as humans and live to about the same ages. Alignment .

What’s more, numerous folktales and legends speak of ancient kingdoms and communities of millenary morgants from which the current specimens are said to descend, indicating that these beings are probably another human species that evolved alongside common humans and sylvans. Typically 7-8 feet tall, morgants are large and massive, famous for their binging, drinking and brawling and for their feisty habits. As with humans, morgants seen around the Kingdom can have the most disparate physical traits, complexions of any color, from milky to dark, and hair ranging from curly red locks to thick and wiry black manes. Their cultures and societies are also variegated, having evolved in parallel with those of humans. Fun Nicknames: whales, bruisers, juggernauts, fatsos, pachyderms. Typical Male Names: Balugante, Ferrautto, Fracasso, Gosto, Isoliero, Mandricardo, Marcolfo, Orrilo, Rodomonte, Rubicante, Serpentino, Zibaldone. Typical Female Names: Argaliffa, Badebecca, Gargamella, Marfisa, Mattalista, Megara, Morgetia, Olimpia, Spinella. Surnames and Assorted Titles: name of the father or mother; name of city of origin. How Other Races See Them The custom of enlisting morgants in armies and mercenary companies as champions and stormtroopers, and of arming and training them to commit slaughter has meant that these beings are generally considered formidable fighters and raiders. Owing to their enormous (and proportionate) appetite and to their equally proverbial propensity for brawls, morgants are seen as brawly dealers of slaps and punches, not to mention insatiable consumers of troughs of beans and omelets and numberless carafes of wine. Truth be told, they are meek and accommodating, their natural disposition being more like that of cattle and pachyderms than of bloodthirsty predators. But of course, “Inferno knows no fury like a good person turned bad!” Morgant Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 2. Age. The life expectancy of a morgant is identical to that of a human, or slightly lower. Size. Morgants are between 7 and 9 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Gargantuan. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Sturdy as a Rock. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. Cast-Iron Stomach. Given your pantagruelic bulk, you have to consume double the rations needed to feed a human. However, thanks to your natural resistance to overindulging, you have advantage on all ability checks concerning the consumption of food and drinks. Brawl Feature: Towering.

Mousefolk mature in their teens and live around 80 years. Tiny But Brave Though the tiny, big-eared mousefolk are often overlooked by larger creatures, history is rife with stories of gallant mouse-knights staring down dragons, crossing blades with warlords, and charging into grand battles. It happens that few mousefolk aspire to heroism, but a certain moral compass often compels mousefolk to a higher cause. As a rule, mousefolk are good to their neighbors and rarely pick fights; after all, most people can be reasoned with. Those who can’t be reasoned with, however, should rightly fear mousefolk striking at their knees. Mousefolk don’t suffer bullies lightly. Despite their valorous legacies, no histories are written about the mousefolk culture itself. This is because the mousefolk language, Rodentia, has no written form, and mousefolk preserve thier history in stories and songs passed from elders to children throughout the generations. Hooded or Disgraced Though ratlings have long abandoned the old ways, a mouseling is never to be seen without a hood. Following ancient tradition, mouselings wear hoods they have sewn themselves at all times, except in the most dire of circumstances. A hood is a symbol of wealth and social standing, and is sometimes replaced with hats or other headwear when appropriate. If a mouseling is seen without a hood, it is a sure sign of disgrace and exile, the most personal punishment a village of mouselings can inflict. Mousefolk Traits Slight and swift, you possess the following traits: Ability Score Increase. Increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Typical: Dexterity +2, Charisma +1 Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size. You are Small. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light, and darkness as if it was dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Lightfooted. You have proficiency in the Stealth skill. Scurry. You can move through the space of any hostile creature as if it were difficult terrain. Squeeze. You suffer no penalty for squeezing through a space that is only large enough for a creature that is one size smaller than you. Mousefolk Lineage. Mousefolk belong to a lineage of mouselings or ratlings. Choose one of the following lineage options: Mouseling’s Sidestep. When a creature you can see makes an opportunity attack against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t use this trait when wearing medium or heavy armor. Ratling’s Gnaw. You can use your action to chew through and break a small nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried, like a rope, a wooden rod or handle, or a length of fabric. If you chew on a wooden wall or floor for 1 minute, you can gnaw a hole large enough for a Tiny creature. You can’t chew through materials that are harder than your teeth, such as metal, stone, or crystal.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Mage Hand Press","book":"Valda's Spire of Secrets"},{"name":"Mousquetaire","description":"Mousquetaires are slivers of powerful beings inside a Tiny creature or object. They come to the Material Plane at the behest of a higher authority, such as a god or archfey, to execute a single piece of a greater plan. Their size is critical to the task's success, minimizing the amount of influence and attention the authority has in the mortal realm. This peculiar union of Tiny mortal and powerful being results in the host performing feats that it could never accomplish on its own. Though the name mousquetaire implies the prevalence of rodents as the targets of greater powers, these beings also inhabit insects, plants, and objects. When it comes into being, a mousquetaire bears an illuminated scar, bib, or cape. Mousquetaires can immediately identify other mousquetaires and recognize the entity that created them. Mousquetaires come into being with a specific, completable task set upon them. When they have completed this mission, their spirit returns to their authority and their host returns to normal. A mousquetaire is free to abandon their task, but they may soon find that the authority’s power begins to fade and they start to lose control of their host. Their time is typically short no matter what choices they make. But surely, the mousquetaire will always leave a large impact on the world behind them. Mousquetaire Traits As a mousquetaire, you have the following traits. Inhabited . You have two creature types: one provided by your base creature below, and your choice of Celestial, Fey, or Fiend. An effect that affects either of your creature types affects you. Ability Score Increase . When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Age . No matter their shape or form before becoming a mousquetaire, the base creature doesn’t age. Size . Your size is Tiny (see “Special Size Rules”). Speed . Your walking speed is 20 feet, and you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Base Creature . Choose one of the following base creatures to inhabit. This body takes on a more humanoid appearance when you assume control: Insect . You are a Beast. You have proficiency in the Athletics skill. Object . You are a Construct. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe. While you remain motionless, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary object. Plant . You are a Plant. You do not need to eat. Each day at dawn, you grow a number of berries equal to your proficiency bonus. You can feed one of these berries to a creature (or it can consume the berry on its own) as a bonus action to restore 1 hit point. The berries lose their potency after 24 hours. Rodent . You are a Beast. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Undead . You are an Undead. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe. You have resistance to necrotic damage. Bounding Body . You don’t take damage as a result of falling. Steadfast . When you take damage, you can use your reaction to immediately take on an otherworldly glow. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: Once on each of your turns, you deal an additional 1d4 force damage to a target when you deal damage to it with an attack or spell. When you make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. You can't use this trait again until you finish a long rest. Languages . You can speak one language of your choice and a second language based on your second creature type (Celestial for Celestial, Sylvan for Fey, and Abyssal or Infernal for Fiend).

The ravenous and unrelenting darakhul seek domination over everything in their path. The inscrutable madness of the derro make them dangerous to creatures in reach of their domain. The calculating and dispassionate drow put their own survival above everything else. With so many inhospitable, or openly evil, forces at play in the Underworld, one race lives a more-or-less peaceful life in the depths of the world: the mushroomfolk. A Diverse Physiognomy The physical appearance of mushroomfolk is even more diverse than their flesh-and-blood counterparts. They have evolved appendages resembling arms and legs, as well as organs for taking in sensory information. Beyond that, they can be as different from one another as surface fungi are from each other, even within the same clan. Some mushroomfolk are tall and thin with caps like toadstools, while others might be short and squat like puffballs. Their diversity strengthens the survivability of their race and their clan. Mushroomfolk have no gender, and they are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Roughly once a year, a mushroomfolk is capable of creating a copy of itself via a specialized spore, which takes about 5 years to become an adult mushroomfolk. It’s also possible for two mushroomfolk to combine spores and create a completely new type of mushroomfolk. This process takes longer, and usually only takes place when the clan is in a settlement phase. An adult grows from this process after about 10 years, but such individuals are considered hardier and a good omen for a clan. Clans of Wanderers and Settlers The lives of the mushroomfolk are concerned mainly with the search for, or the tending of, sources of nutrition. This concern dictates the lifestyle, religion, ethos, and survival of the mushroomfolk. Clans of the creatures wander the Underworld until they find an area rich in the nutrition they need to survive. If a large area of potential nutrition is found, the wandering clan changes its mode of operation. Specialists in raising creatures or farming vegetation take over, letting the scouts and wayfinders rest for a bit. At the same time, the scouts and wanderers from other clans might encounter a settled clan. Wandering newcomers join the settled clan for a time, learn from them, share spores to strengthen the clans, and determine if the clans must combine or split to ensure optimal chances of survival. Clans may settle for a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years. At some point, however, the nutrition runs out. Then the clan switches survival modes again, repeating the process as scouts are deployed and the clan goes on the move. Mushroomfolk Religion The mushroomfolk gain sustenance from death and decay. Unlike the darakhul, however, they feed on creatures and vegetation that have died naturally and started to decay. This reliance on putrescence as a form of food often seems ghoulish to outsiders—or at least it seems so until the outsider encounters the true ghouls of the Underworld. During important times of the year, the mushroomfolk perform elaborate rituals involving the finding and the harvesting of food: when scouts leave or return, when important sites of sustenance are found, when scouts of other clans join them or leave, etc. Even during less important times, the mushroomfolk have small rites and rituals they perform that others might not even notice. Experts in religion who watch these rituals recognize them as a spattering of rites from different faiths. The most prevalent offerings revolve around the worship of Anu-Akma, the Lord of the Underworld and one of the main deities of the darakhul. However, the mushroomfolk have no idea of the power they are worshipping: they simply revere the force that brings the decay and rot that they need to survive. Relations with the Darakhul The mushroomfolk have an interesting and unique relationship with the darakhul. They are no threat to the darakhul, but nor are they a potential food source. The darakhul, on the other hand, are a tasty treat to the mushroomfolk—even when still in an undead state, but especially after they have been destroyed. This is disconcerting to the darakhul. On the other hand, the trusting and placid nature of the mushroomfolk makes them a useful tool for the darakhul. Darakhul spies can count on getting honest intelligence from mushroomfolk scouts or clans they encounter, which might be useful in their subjugation of the Underworld. The mushroomfolk also understand that where darakhul armies march, there is often death, with rotting bodies to give them sustenance. Mushroomfolk Names A mushroomfolk is given a name by the clan leaders when it becomes old enough to take on important work for the clan. The individual receives a name for itself, and it also takes on the name of its clan. A mushroomfolk without a clan only uses its given name, or it might take on a pseudonym if it lives in shame for past misdeeds. Individual Names: Arhk, Bussle, Carntul, Darvish, Furnum, Garbelt, Haredt, Jarbish, Lever, Mivel, Paruuk, Qibble, Staphle, Vassil Clan Names: Aaughot, Chough, Dousku, Guush, Hoovush, Kushuk, Nouhuph, Phushmug, Shublum, Unugh, Wurnush Mushroomfolk Traits Your mushroomfolk character has certain characteristics in common with all other mushroomfolk. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2. Age. Mushroomfolk reach maturity by the age of 5 and rarely live longer than 50 years. Size. Mushroomfolk size is determined by their subrace. Alignment. The limited interaction mushroomfolk have with other creatures leaves them with a mostly neutral view of the world in terms of good and evil, while their societal structure makes them more prone to law than chaos. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Fungoid Form. You are a humanoid, though the fungal nature of your body and your unique diet of decayed vegetable and animal matter marks you with some plant-like characteristics. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance to poison damage. In addition, you are immune to disease. Hardy Survivor. Your upbringing in mushroomfolk society has taught you how to defend yourself and find food. You have proficiency in the Survival skill. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Mushroomfolk and your choice of Common or Undercommon. Subrace. Three subraces of mushroomfolk are known to wander Midgard: acid cap, favored, and morel. Choose one of these subraces. Playing a Mushroomfolk The close-knit nature of mushroomfolk clans generally makes the tales of mushroomfolk PCs hard-luck stories. Most likely your clan was destroyed by some Underworld threat, and you now wander the world looking for a new family. Maybe you were exiled from your clan for some reason, and you were adopted by some other race or a group of adventurers. You even might be off on a long-term mission to collect information about an area, serving your clan in that way, and you will return only when you feel you have enough interesting data to provide. Mushroomfolk Subraces Because of the multitude of physical makeups of mushroomfolk, there are great differences among and within the clans.

During important times of the year, the mushroomfolk perform elaborate rituals involving the finding and the harvesting of food: when scouts leave or return, when important sites of sustenance are found, when scouts of other clans join them or leave, or similar. Even during less important times, the mushroomfolk have small rites and rituals they perform that others might not even notice. Experts in religion who watch these rituals recognize them as a spattering of rites from different faiths. The most prevalent offerings mimic those involved in the worship of deities of death and life-death cycles. However, the mushroomfolk have no idea of the powers they are worshipping: they simply revere the forces that bring the decay and rot that they need to survive. Relations with the Darakhul The mushroomfolk have an interesting and unique relationship with the darakhul. They are no threat to the darakhul, but nor are they a potential food source. The darakhul, on the other hand, are a tasty treat to the mushroomfolk—even when still in an undead state, but especially after they have been destroyed. This is disconcerting to the darakhul. On the other hand, the trusting and placid nature of the mushroomfolk makes them a useful tool for the darakhul. Darakhul spies can count on getting honest intelligence from mushroomfolk scouts or clans they encounter, which might be useful in their conquering beneath the surface. The mushroomfolk also understand that where darakhul armies march, there is often death, with rotting bodies to give them sustenance. Mushroomfolk Names A mushroomfolk is given a name by the clan leaders when it becomes old enough to take on important work for the clan. The individual receives a name for itself, and it also takes on the name of its clan. A mushroomfolk without a clan uses only its given name, or it might take on a pseudonym if it lives in shame for past misdeeds. Individual Names: Arhk, Bussle, Carntul, Darvish, Furnum, Garbelt, Haredt, Jarbish, Lever, Mivel, Paruuk, Qibble, Staphle, Vassil Clan Names: Aaughot, Chough, Dousku, Guush, Hoovush, Kushuk, Nouhuph, Phushmug, Shublum, Unugh, Wurnush Mushroomfolk Traits Your mushroomfolk character has certain characteristics in common with all other mushroomfolk. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2. Age. Mushroomfolk reach maturity by the age of 5 and rarely live longer than 50 years. Size. A mushroomfolk’s size is determined by its subrace. Alignment. The limited interaction mushroomfolk have with other creatures leaves them with a fairly neutral view of the world in terms of good and evil, while their societal structure makes them more prone to law than chaos. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Fungoid Form. You are a humanoid, though the fungal nature of your body and your unique diet of decayed vegetable and animal matter marks you with some plant-like characteristics. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance to poison damage. In addition, you are immune to disease. Hardy Survivor. Your upbringing in mushroomfolk society has taught you how to defend yourself and find food. You have proficiency in the Survival skill. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Mushroomfolk and your choice of Common or Undercommon. Subrace. Three subraces of mushroomfolk are known to wander the world: acid cap, favored, and morel. Choose one of these subraces. Playing a Mushroomfolk The close-knit nature of mushroomfolk clans generally makes the tales of mushroomfolk characters hard-luck stories. Most likely your clan was destroyed by some underground threat, and you now wander the world looking for a new family. Maybe you were exiled from your clan for some reason, and you were adopted by some other race or a group of adventurers. You even might be off on a long-term mission to collect information about an area, serving your clan in that way, and you will return only when you feel you have enough interesting information to provide.

That’s been happening more and more ever since the mycelians moved into town.” - Roul Todogh, Baker Reusing and recycling are key tenets in the life of any mycelian (my-SEE-lee-an). Nothing is waste; rotten food can fatten a pig, a ruined shirt is a bandage waiting to happen, and corpses are new homes in need of a little bit of reinvigoration. Marginalised and persecuted by most societies, mycelians’ propensity to recycle the recently deceased often brings them into conflict with other humanoids. That being said, graverobbers and less scrupulous grey market traders have been known to make a pretty penny out of selling ageing mycelians their next vessels. Reuse and Recycle Mycelians reanimate the bodies of the recently deceased. Understandably, many more ‘civilised’ races disagree with this practice—it’s difficult to meet your uncle again a few hours after interring him. Moreover, mycelians don’t have the same regenerative abilities as the body’s original inhabitant; wounds are patched over with a web of hyphae, the skin takes on a pale pallor, and the body wears out fairly quickly, lasting six to seven years. Much like hermit crabs wear shells, mycelians inoculate corpses with microscopic spores, before growing a web of hyphae through the body. Nerves are co-opted, muscles are repaired, and fungal organs replace the internal viscera of the host. The process is entirely biological, but less tolerant denizens of the world often believe these reanimated bodies to be the work of necromancers, treating mycelians as infectious, living dead. The key to distinguishing a mycelian from a zombie, of course, is the smell. Mycelians carry a hearty, musky aroma like that of a vivacious forest floor. Undead, on the other hand, carry the putrid-sweet scent of decay. After several unfortunate interactions with necromancer-hunters, the Sisters of Mercy began employing dogs, with their keen sense of smell, to help differentiate between innocent mycelians and undead artifice. Ancestors and Aging With each new host, a mycelian’s psyche changes a little, moulded by the brain, body, and abilities of the host it co-opts. In moving from one host to another, a mycelian also leaves behind some of its own memories, forever lost to the decay of time. Despite being potentially thousands of years old, the longest-living communities of mycelians often have memories stretching back only a few decades. For this reason, mycelians conduct a ritual shortly before death, where they recant a rhythmic history of their exploits in this host, adding it to the oral history of their community. These oral histories can be days long, and minor word changes (or ‘linguistic decay’ as scholars refer to it) have resulted in tales becoming more and more outlandish the further back in time they occurred. Legend of the Mothershroom Every mycelian oral history has one thing in common: its beginning. These stories all start with the ‘Mothershroom’, a behemoth fungal organism and progenitor to all mycelians. In some stories, the Mothershroom takes the form of a giant, multi-coloured tree. In others, it is a miles-wide web of interconnecting, pulsing hyphae that thrum with thought and feeling. Despite their best efforts, no mycelian, explorer, or scholar has ever found the Mothershroom. Any knowledge of its location—if it even exists—has been lost to the grinding wheel of time. Many mycelians have embarked on quests to find their ancient ancestor. For some such adventurers, the desire to find this holy figure is the only memory they retain between bodies. Mycelian Traits As a mycelian, you have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1 (which is typically indicative of your host corpse). Age . In the right conditions, a corpse inoculated with mycelial spores can rise as a newly-formed, adult mycelian in under a month. Mycelians tend to wear out a host in less than 7 years, and periodically redeploy their personal spores to animate a new, fresher corpse. Theoretically, a mycelian can live on indefinitely, their minds and personalities changing with each rebirth. Creature Type . You are a humanoid. You are also considered a plant for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a plant. Languages . You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Size . Mycelians run the full gamut of humanoid races, from 2-foot-tall gnomes to 8-foot-tall golynns. Your height, weight, and size are determined by the race to which your host corpse belonged in life. It is typically Small or Medium. Speed . Your base walking speed is dictated by the race to which your host corpse belonged in life. It is typically 25 or 30 feet . Symbiotic Assimilation . Your unique lifecycle allows you to co-opt some of the adaptations of your host corpse. Choose two of the following adaptations; the race to which your host corpse belonged must have had this racial trait in order for you to choose it (GM’s discretion). Damage Resistance (Multiple). You have resistance to one damage type determined by your host body’s race. Darkvision (Multiple). The darkened chambers of The Low are your home. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey. Dwarven Resilience (Dwarf). You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. Halfling Nimbleness (Halfling). You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Muscle Memory (Any). You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice. You can take this option multiple times. Natural Weapon (Multiple). You have a physical characteristic, such as horns, claws, or teeth, that acts as a natural melee weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (depending on the body part) equal to your Strength modifier plus a damage die determined by your host body’s race, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Powerful Build (Multiple). You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Relentless Endurance (Half-Orc). When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this trait again until you finish a long rest. Spore Spray . As a reaction when a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can attempt to poison it with a burst of spores. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw ( DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or take 1d8 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn. You can use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. This damage increases to 2d8 at 5th level. Insporeation . When you die within 100 feet of a humanoid corpse that has been dead no longer than 24 hours , and that hasn’t been subjected to magic that accelerates decay or prevents decay (such as the gentle repose spell), you can use your dying breath to eject spores to inhabit that corpse. Roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or higher than the distance between your body and the corpse in feet, your spores take hold. For example, a target 30 feet away requires a roll of 30 or higher to succeed. On a success, the new body rises again in 2d6 days. You gain the benefits of a long rest and lose your previous Symbiotic Assimilation adaptations, gaining new ones according to the race of the target corpse. On a failure, you die as normal.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Loot Tavern","book":"Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting - Compendium"},{"name":"Naga","description":"Scaled, serpentine beings with innate psychic abilities, naga are very physically different from humans. They move by slithering on their massive snake tails, which account for their bodies from the waist down. The typical naga is roughly fifteen feet from head to tail, rising to about eight when balancing themselves upright. Naga Physiology For all appearances half-human and half-serpent, the naga share many aspects with snakes and serpents. They are human-looking from the waist up, albeit covered in thin snakeskin and plated scutes, and have other serpentine traits as well. Among these is a far higher sense of smell than human beings, and the ability to “taste” the air with their forked tongues. Their eyes can perceive the glow of a living being’s natural heat in the dark, and they can sense the vibrations caused by movement on the ground or in the water. Like snakes, they can unhinge their jaws and unfurl long fangs. They are also natural swimmers, capable of breathing through their skin while submerged. Due to their cold blood, naga tend to hibernate during the cold season. The Unity In addition to their heightened senses, the naga’s apparent sixth sense allows them to speak to one another through their own thoughts, even across long distances, by entering into a trancelike state. This ability is normally very weak, but it can be trained over time, built up like a muscle. Masters of this sixth sense are able to communicate over vast distances, project a sort of etheric image of themselves, or even directly transfer constructed memories. Masters can spend hours in the trance state, communing with one another in a spiritual union of their minds. Their thoughts can sometimes become tangled when this occurs, a state referred to as the Council. The Council is not a separate being, but an amalgamation of thought that possesses the collective perspectives of all participants, speaking on behalf of all. Naga in Human Guise Those who believe historical naga sightings and recognize them from tales of the Ivory Kingdoms are also likely to believe that Rokugani naga have never ventured beyond the Shinomen. They would be mistaken, as naga possess an innate ability to disguise themselves. The naga disguise is a projected image, constructed from a combination of pheromones and dream magic, bending light and befuddling the senses to appear as an ordinary human being. Naga refer to this as “charming.” The illusion can be as complex as the naga desires, though each disguise takes extensive practice; most naga only ever learn to create and maintain one or two illusory identities. Naga Traits As a naga, you benefit from the following: Ability Score Increase . Choose two different ability scores to increase by 1. Age . Naga can live for thousands of years, and often slumber for centuries. As such, they do not measure their age in seasons or years but in moltings. Like snakes, as they age, naga molt their skins; the first molting is an important event in a naga’s life, and the shed skin is often cured and kept as a memento from one’s youth. The ninth molting is equally important, because it marks the beginning of adulthood and one’s path through life. Though these moltings can take place essentially at any time, most naga who are nine moltings old have lived at least a century. Size . You are fifteen feet or longer from head to tail and tower over most humans, but you are also quite lithe. As such, despite your length, you are Medium. Speed . Your base walking speed is 35 feet. You also have a swimming speed of 35 feet. Amphibious . If you are in clean fresh water, you can breathe while submerged. Cold-Blooded . You have disadvantage on checks and saving throws to resist the effects of extreme cold, and are vulnerable to cold damage. Expanded Senses . You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. Further, you can see sources of heat within 30 feet of you, which appear as silhouettes that range from yellow (cool) to bright red (very hot). Additionally, you can feel vibrations at a range of 30 feet, allowing you to sense movement within this range if you share a contact surface with the moving creature or object. This grants you advantage on your passive Perception (a +5 bonus) when it involves detecting a creature approaching you stealthily. This does not apply to flying or incorporeal creatures. Serpentine Charming . You can passively maintain an illusory identity that allows you to walk among other species without notice. To onlookers, you seem to be a member of another species of your choice, perhaps riding a mount or flanked by attendants to account for your size. Most creatures accept this illusion unless they are given reason to question it. To pierce through this illusion, a creature who suspects you must make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check with DC equal to 12 plus your proficiency bonus. You can change the details of this identity after you complete a long rest. The Unity . During a short or long rest, instead of gaining the benefits of resting, you can send a telepathic message to one creature that you know at any distance. The target (and only the target) hears the message, but cannot reply unless it also has this ability. Language .

When he arrived, the captains were all shouting in different languages over the comms. It was a furious, incomprehensible tangle of Avia-ra, Gnomish, and Elvish, with an undiplomatic number of rude gestures thrown around in lieu of any real communication. Titus bellowed over the three of them: his colossal voice booming out of his aqua suit, first in Common, then in each of their three languages. He translated tactfully for all parties and an agreement was shortly reached, but everyone knew that the captains acquiesced moreso because none of them wanted to see the towering nautilid cross again.\" — Sgt. Larren, recounting his nautilid engineer A race of universe-spanning travelers, the hulking, fishlike nautilids patrol space in their massive whorl ships, exploring and cataloging any planet with enough water to sustain a colony. Few ever see these creatures’ true forms, for they are most often concealed in imposing suits, which look more like antique diving gear than sophisticated survival apparatuses. Orphan Race Though the nautilids are among the oldest races in the ‘verse, they are fast dying out. Long after the nautilids discovered Dark Matter technology and started traversing the universe, disaster struck their homeworld, Poseidon, a vast planet of endless ocean. Their star began to grow rapidly in size, first heating the water, then boiling the oceans away; within a few short decades, a supernova claimed the planet, leaving only scattered colonies and immense nautilid colony ships. Without a homeworld, the nautilids have been an orphan race, growing up on small colonies and inside massive colony ships called whorls, which travel the universe. Their numbers dwindle with each decade that passes, and if nothing changes, the next few centuries might see the end of the nautilids altogether. Endless Odyssey Ingenious and never to be defeated, the nautilids have searched tirelessly, jumping from planet to planet in pursuit of a new homeworld. The oceans of Poseidon had a very specific aquatic composition of rare elements and dissolved gases, known as the Poseidon Solution. Though nautilids can live in both air and water, they do so uncomfortably, and can only relax (and produce offspring) in a similar solution. So far, the Poseidon Solution hasn't been found occurring naturally on planets with oceans; it has only been reproduced in quantities small enough to fill the nautilid whorl ships and their aqua suits. Finding oceans in the ‘verse is rare enough, but finding a suitable replacement for Poseidon has been a centuries-long challenge for the entire nautilid race. Nautilid Names By ancient tradition, nautilids are named in the old languages of Poseidon, and the second half of a nautilid’s name is composed of a surname, passed down the maternal line. The meaning of most of these names have been lost to history, much like Poseidon itself. Nautilid Names. Agrias, Charax, Democedes, Gorgias, Helenos, Idomeneus, Isokrates, Lysandros, Monomachus, Panthous, Theomestros, Xenagoras Nautilid Traits Your great, amphibious body and your constantly-worn aqua suit give you the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1. Age. Nautilids reach maturity by 20 years of age, and individuals have been recorded to live as long as 150 years. Alignment. Stoic and contemplative, nautilids tend to be lawful. Size. Lumbering and stout, nautilids stand between 6 and 8 feet tall, seeming even larger in their cumbersome aqua suits. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet. Amphibious. You can breathe water as well as air, though breathing air is uncomfortable for you without assistance. Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Deductive. You have proficiency in the Investigation skill. Aqua Suit. Except when you are aboard a whorl ship, you wear a bulky aqua suit, which is filled with Poseidon Solution, in order to breathe comfortably. The suit covers your whole body, including a large domed helmet with circular windows that allow you to see without hindrance. Without the suit, you can breathe air or water, but doing so delivers air inefficiently to your lungs, and you feel much the same as a human does in very thin air. You can don or doff the helmet on your turn as part of your action, and you can don or doff the entire suit in 1 minute. If damaged directly but not completely destroyed, the suit rapidly mends itself, leaking only a very small amount of water. While wearing the suit, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Other armor can be fitted to attach around the aqua suit at no cost. While no other armor is fitted to it, you count as being unarmored for the purposes of features such as Unarmored Defense. Additionally, while wearing the suit, you have resistance to fire damage. The suit counts as a life suit and is also equipped with an embedded universal translator magic item, which you can use at will. Languages.

These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown. Genesis 6:4 After God had created humans, he sent 200 angels, led by the lieutenant Shemichaza, to watch the newly made species. Although they were supposed to keep their distance, the angels fell in love with the daughters and sons of mankind. Out of their union came children, taller and even more beautiful than humans, much adored by all living beings – the nephilim. God was furious and decided to punish the perpetrators. He bound the Watchers in a deep cave and sent the flood to kill all humans and nephilim. Only one son of Shemichaza survived, as Noah took pity on him and allowed him on the ark. From him came the species of nephilim. Even more than is true for the tieflings, the fate of this species is to slowly deteriorate. As there have only been very few opportunities for the nephilim to lie with angels, that only leaves other nephilim and humans to mate with. There are no known successful matings of nephilim with any of the other species. Speculation about the reasons for that phenomenon include racial prejudice and biological incompatibility. In 1492, their numbers are few and their existence is known only to a few humans. Nephilim have been hiding their true identities for the past 1500 years, after their most prominent member Jehoshua ben Josef (also known as Jeshua, Jesus) was executed for wanting to unite humans and non-humans in the grace of God as well as for his “pretense” of being the Mashiach (messiah). In the centuries following the crucifixion, nephilim often used their ethereal appearance to pass as elves. Today – as elves are also being forgotten – they just try to go unnoticed. Their families usually live in old castles or mansions far from the growing cities. Nephilim Traits Appearance. The more the nephilim mate with humans, the more they lose their angelic traits. The first nephilim were mighty beings, true giants with wonderful wings spanning up to 26 feet (approx. 8 meters). Depending on the purity of their blood, nephilim will still look somewhat angelic, with very light skin and graceful features. But only very pure and ancient nephilim have retained wings that allow them to fly. Nephilim who venture into human society merely have small wings that can fold behind their backs to be hidden beneath clothes. These won’t be longer than 3 feet (less than 1 meter), but every naphil (single form of nephilim) will feel the urge to unfold them at least once a day. Being deprived of this freedom makes him or her irritable and will actually hurt. Nephilim are taller than most humans and of slender build. They have no facial hair, but very fine long body hair almost indiscernible to the naked eye. They basically look like elves minus the pointy ears, plus small wings. It is no wonder that these two species get easily confused. Nephilim do, nevertheless, have two other very distinctive traits: they have neither navels nor nipples. This comes from the fact that nephilim come from eggs. By the time they hatch – usually a year after the egg is laid – they are able to stand and be fed normally. It will then only take them 5–7 years to mature physically. That makes them of course not any wiser than human children. Just more dangerous. They may already be skilled swordsmen and -women by the age of 8, but will they know when to wield a weapon? Mostly not, which is one other reason why nephilim families avoid human contact and keep their offspring close until they are actually prepared to reason and interact wisely. But even the most reclusive nephilim clans let their young members leave home for a few years to get to know the world and learn why it might be better to stay away from it. A nephilim PC will not be younger than 25 or 30. Ability score increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1, and your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. As mentioned above, nephilim initially mature quickly, but then they age slowly. This is why nephilim can become very old, up to 250 years, but will usually not interact with humans past the age of 60, which is when they look like 30. Alignment. If you use alignments in your campaign, nephilim do not have an inherent preference, but only very few will actually be evil. Size. Nephilim are usually not shorter than 6 feet (approx. 1.8 meters). Although they can be much taller, only nephilim of less than 6.5 feet (approx. 2 meters) in height will be allowed to interact with humans. Please note that the average size of humans in 1492 was considerably smaller than it is today, so a person 2 meters tall is huge! Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Float. Your short wings do not enable you to fly but you can float or hover for a short period. This comes in handy when falling from great heights or having to levitate a bit. You will of course have to remove your clothes to use the wings. Enchanting music. Nephilim are masters of song and music. A fully matured naphil will be able to play at least one instrument and sing beautifully, and with this combination can charm any humanoid within a 30 feet (a bit less than 10 meters) radius. The person(s) affected must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your charisma modifier, and will do so with advantage if they are fighting the naphil or his group. If they fail, they will calm down, feel peaceful and positively inclined towards the character. It requires 1 action to cast, but then the spell lasts as long as the song continues, no longer than 5 minutes though. This ability can be a very powerful tool, but please be aware that it will only work if you can play and sing at the same time and the target(s) can actually hear you. It won’t work if your hands are bound, you are gagged or if the targets cannot hear you for some reason. Languages. Apart from the human language of the country they live in, nephilim will understand and speak the original angelic language. Many families also preserve the old Aramaic from the times when they still interacted openly with humans. Religion. Perhaps unsurprisingly, nephilim are mostly Christians. Depending on their provenance, they will usually either be Roman Catholic or Orthodox. Still, some adhere to gnostic or other “heretical” versions of Christianity. Not all are fanatics, but you do find quite a few zealots amongst the members of this species. Starting with Jehoshua, these were often responsible for major developments and schisms in the history of Christianity. A Jewish nephilim is possible, but he or she will definitely be an outcast amongst the followers of most prominent nephilim. Odd fact. Nephilim are vegetarians and will not kill animals unless attacked by them.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Vortex Verlag","book":"The Straight Way Lost"},{"name":"Nezumi","description":"The nezumi are humanoid beings who bear a resemblance to rodents and have fur, hairless tails, and dexterous paws. Many nezumi lived in the lands to the south of what would be Rokugan, prior to the foundation of the Emerald Empire. However, when Fu Leng’s fall scorched the sky and shattered the earth, their civilization was devastated. And when Fu Leng’s anguish twisted the oni of the deepest pits of the underworld, unthinkable monsters spread forth from the howling wound in the Mortal Realm to sow chaos and destruction. Some nezumi fled north, settling in the Shinomen Forest, while others remained in their ancient homeland even as it transformed into the seething wastes called the Shadowlands, proving very resilient in the face of this horror. Nezumi are almost entirely immune to becoming subsumed by Fu Leng’s dominating will while alive, nor do their dead rise as monstrosities if left buried in the Shadowlands. They can eat the twisted plants and animals that grow in the Shadowlands, and drink the brackish, defiled water. Monsters may stalk the land and vile spirits haunt the wastes, but the nezumi are courageous and cunning. And so the nezumi have persisted for millennia in a realm that can destroy an incautious human in a matter of hours. Nezumi Physiology Furred, with clawed feet and hands, ratlike noses, and long tails, nezumi are smaller than most humans but quick and perceptive. They average roughly four feet in height, but this varies between individuals, as does fur color, whisker length, and whether the individual prefers to walk on two or four feet. Their senses of smell and hearing are quite sharp compared to those of most humans, and most can react to danger as quickly as a trained human soldier, thanks in part to their sensitive whiskers. Many nezumi live only three or four years, though some have been known to live quite a bit longer, with the most venerable nezumi known reaching the ages of twelve to fifteen years. Their impressive rate of reproduction keeps up their numbers, but given the short time between generations, nezumi must work hard to maintain their traditions and culture over even a relatively short span of years. Yesterday Remembered The nezumi Rememberers are their sages, capable of using the magic of the Realm of Dreams to preserve visions of the past for future generations. They tell of a golden age, when the nezumi were united in a single kingdom that was renowned even in faraway lands. Its warriors were respected and their scholars praised, and they sent envoys to faraway lands in the icy mountains to the far north and the many islands to the south. Then, a falling mountain crashed through their capital, sending it forever into the Realm of Dreams. In an instant, untold nezumi perished. Evil leaked into the world, and corruption spread across their lands, withering fields and transforming beings into vile beasts—all except the nezumi, who alone proved resilient. At least, this is the tale Rememberers of the nezumi tell. Nezumi Traits As a nezumi, you benefit from the following: Ability Score Increase . Choose one ability score to increase by 2, and another to increase by 1. Age . Most nezumi live only a few years, though some individuals have been known to live more than a decade. Size . Nezumi are on average short and slight compared with humans, ranging from three to five feet tall in most cases. You are Small. Speed . Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Adapted to the Shadowlands . You are able to eat the food and water of the Shadowlands without risk, have advantage on saving throws against the powers and abilities of Lost creatures, and do not suffer the usual penalties for undertaking a long rest in the Shadowlands (see Provisions and Resting in the Shadowlands ). Evade by a Whisker . Your whiskers can detect airflow changes, letting you sidestep attacks seemingly before they are thrown. Increase your AC against opportunity attacks by +2. Sharp Senses . You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. Skitter . You can run on all fours at impressive speeds. By spending a bonus action, you can drop onto all fours to skitter. You can wield only a single one-handed weapon, and your base walking speed becomes 40 feet. You also gain a climb speed of 40 feet. You can stop skittering by spending a bonus action to stand back up onto your hind legs. Language .

There are many kinds of nymphs—dryads of the forests, naiads of the rivers, oreads of the mountains, aurae of the night sky, and nereids of the sea. They have walked the earth for millennia, ever since the Great Mother awakened them from the trees, waters, rocks, and breezes. Nymphs are most at home in nature, but they have been known to disguise themselves and live amongst mortals, for they are desperately curious about the civilized world. In spite of this, they often have a difficult time comprehending the day-to-day struggle of civilized existence. Their charms are such that they may inadvertently seduce and domesticate mortal ‘pets’ who see to their every need, leaving them somewhat puzzled by the ugliness and hardship that seems to pervade cities. Legend of the Nymphs There was once a river running through the mountains. None can say which river or which mountains, for this was so long ago that the land has rolled and shifted so as to become unrecognizable in the time since. The mountains were blanketed in a soft powder of white snow, and as the snow melted, it crept along the ground and joined together into streams of water, which trickled along the rocks and formed a river. And the river coursed down through a forest, emptying into the ocean. So it went for eons. But then one day, the snow on the mountains had a thought. “Am I alike to the water in the streams?” And so also did the water in the river begin to wonder, “Am I alike to the roots of the trees?” They were curious, but it seemed that they would never know the answer, for just as the snow went to inspect the streams, it became the water, and just as the water went to inspect the trees, it became the roots. And so it went for eons. Eventually, the Great Mother herself became aware of these questions. Holding the world in her embrace, she felt the curiosity of the elements rippling and vibrating across its surface, anxious for answers. And so, she loosened her grip—just slightly. The rippling thoughts of the snow and the waters and the rocks and the trees took shape, and their shapes were beautiful, for they were curiosity made manifest. These were the first nymphs. Beautiful and Diverse Nymphs are famed for their feminine charms, but they are not exclusively female. Some are awakened from the elements with a mix of masculine and feminine features, and others are quintessential specimens of male splendor. As fey creatures, nymphs like little less than to be nailed down by the crude shackles of mortal language. They come in as many shapes and forms as the earth itself. The only physical trait that all of them have in common is an awe-inspiring beauty. Curious and Possessive Nymphs have an insatiable desire to learn as much as possible about both the natural and the civilized world. Because most have had eons to discover the splendor of nature, it is the civilized world that interests them the most. However, they are not usually very accustomed to mortal culture, and so they may think of men and women as interesting baubles to be collected and admired. Even civilized nymphs tend to cherish their friends and acquaintances as ‘pets’ to be manicured and proudly exhibited. They are not above bragging about their collection—or fighting with one another over their favorites. Nymph Names Nymphs have names that sound beautiful and elemental. Male Names : Celano, Elion, Eratheis, Hyllis, Limnade, Linos, Myrmex, Olbia, Pega, Potameid, Pyron, Taygete Female Names : Aegle, Alcyone, Arethusa, Asterope, Brettia, Brisa, Calybe, Crinae, Crimisa, Dodone, Electra, Erythia, Hesperia, Himalia, Oeneis, Laodice, Maia, Merope, Polydora, Rhene, Semestra Nymph Traits Nymphs have the following traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age . Nymphs are born cocooned within some feature of their associated element. For example, dryads are usually born within trees, and nereids may be born within giant clamshells. Young nymphs sleep in their cocoon for up to one hundred years before emerging, fully mature. They can live for as long as one thousand years, although many choose to return to the elements once their curiosity about the world has been satisfied. Alignment. Nymphs tend toward chaotic alignments. They understand the concepts of good and evil, but they tend to select one or the other based on impulse rather than any deep-seated conviction. Nymphs tend to make a game out of performing acts that characterize their chosen alignment, rather than pausing for serious introspection. Size . Nymphs are the same size as humans, but their builds typically reflect a life of leisure. Your size is Medium. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Languages . You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. Enthralling Beauty . You possess unearthly grace and beauty, which allows you to dazzle and charm those who are susceptible to such things. You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill. Additionally, you can cast the charm person spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Nymph Ancestry . When you create your nymph, choose one of the following subraces: Aurae, Dryad, Naiad, Nereid, or Oread. You gain access to special traits and magic depending upon your ancestry. Nymph Subrace: Aurae Aurae are associated with the breezes and the constellations of the night sky. They look like beautiful humans except that in dim lighting, their features are sometimes illuminated by cosmic light. Aurae are considered to be the wisest and most serious-minded nymphs, as they spend their time reflecting upon the eternal nature of the stars. Aurae Ancestry . You have Darkvision out to 60 ft., and you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks when navigating by the stars. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Starting at 7th level, you can cast the levitate spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Nymph Subrace: Dryad Dryads are associated with the forests and trees. They look like beautiful humans but with rough, bark-like skin that ranges in color from earthy browns and greens to flowery pinks and blues. Of all the nymphs, they have the most trouble adapting to civilization, as they do not cope well with being separated from their birth tree. Dryad Ancestry . You are fluent in the languages of beasts and plants, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks in forested regions. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the goodberry spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Starting at 7th level, you can cast the barkskin spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Nymph Subrace: Naiad Naiads are associated with rivers, lakes, and rushing rapids. They look like beautiful humans but with long hair that coils and tumbles like a flowing waterfall from their shoulders. They adapt to civilization easily, as many mortal settlements are built along rivers. Any beautiful human that seems to enjoy bathing just a little too much might be accused of being a naiad. Naiad Ancestry. You can hold your breath for 1 hour, and you have a swimming speed of 40 ft. Starting at 3rd level, you may cast the create or destroy water spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Starting at 7th level, you can cast the control water spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Nymph Subrace: Nereid Nereids are associated with the stormy seas and oceans. They look like beautiful humans but with pearlescent blue-green skin, luminous eyes, and webbed hands and feet. Nereids have no trouble adapting to civilization, but they are a rare sight, because they vastly prefer the ocean to walking on dry land. Nereid Ancestry . You can breathe underwater, and you have a swimming speed of 40 ft. Starting at 3rd level, you may cast the fog cloud spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Starting at 7th level, you can cast the water walk spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Nymph Subrace: Oread Oreads are associated with rocky crags and the snowy peaks of mountains. They look like beautiful humans but with cat-shaped eyes. Oreads are fierce hunters, and they are known to stalk rural areas in search of interesting prey. Any hunter who can live for weeks in the wild and come away looking fresh as a flower might be an oread. Oread Ancestry . You have Darkvision out to 60 ft., and you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks in steppes, rocky islands, and mountainous regions. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the hunter’s mark spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Starting at 7th level, you can cast the misty step spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Arcanum Worlds","book":"Odyssey of the Dragonlords Compendium"},{"name":"Oculus","description":"“When we advanced deep into that cave system, we thought we were going to fight a beholder...what else were we to expect when that villager who hired us told us they saw an eye monster come from the mountain? When we got into that huge cavern, though, there must have been hundreds of them, what I could only describe as human-sized and -shaped eyes, and even weirder...they welcomed us with tea.” —Flop McBurrough, when interviewed about his adventuring party’s first encounter with oculi Oculi are telepathic humanoids whose bodies are entirely made up of a single eye, though they are shaped as most other bipedal humanoids are with arms, legs, a neck, and a head. Each oculi has a single pupil that can be moved anywhere on the surface of its body, allowing it to see at any angle. All Seeing Eyes Oculi do not have bodily orifices, such as ears, mouths, noses, or others. They experience taste, sound, and smell through a shallow and near-imperceptible membrane that surrounds their bodies, detecting and interpreting subtle stimuli. Oculi feed by absorbing nutrients through this membrane from bacteria and other microorganisms. An oculus can also “eat” more traditional foodstuffs by slowly absorbing the nutrients through contact with its membrane. Each oculus has a uniquely colored iris surrounding its large pupil, often with a myriad of intertwining colors. Other than body size and shape, these unique irises are the only way to tell individual oculi apart. An oculus, while aware of bodily harm, does not experience pain as other creatures do. When an oculus’s body has sustained enough damage, it will immediately enter a repair state that acts similarly to another creature’s unconscious state. Watchful Hive Oculi tend to live in underground cave systems in which they carve out structures to use as homes and defensible positions. Due to their ability to telepathically communicate near-instantaneously, a group of oculi, called a watch, develops a sort of hive mind. This hive mind allows them to be efficient and unified in purpose, helping the watch to create elaborate and highly functional structures with incredible efficiency. When living in large groups, oculi very rarely venture from their cave system. They are a self-reliant species that neither depends on nor offers aid to other races. They are aware of the value of gold and treasures for the purposes of the rare interaction or trade with other cultures, but have no use for such things within a watch. Intelligent Design Oculi live extremely long lives when undisturbed, and reproduce asexually when a watch determines more members are needed. This reproduction occurs as a mitosis lasting nearly a century, during which the “parent” decides the evolutionary form its offspring will take. In this way, a watch can regulate a balance of the roles required by oculus society. Oculus Names Oculi typically do not have personal names as each oculus sees itself primarily as an extension of its watch, rather than an individual. When an oculus leaves its watch, though, and learns to live as an individual, it tends to adopt a name from the first culture it encounters. This name might not even be one used by other creatures; it might just be a pleasant-sounding name of an object. Oculus Traits As an oculus, you have the following traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Age. Oculi reach maturity only a few days after their mitosis is complete, and can live for nearly 2000 years. Alignment. As creatures of a heavily structured and deeply self-reliant culture, most oculi are lawful neutral. Size. Oculi can range from 4 feet to nearly 6 feet tall, depending on their evolutionary function, and weigh an average of 140 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. You have a base walking speed of 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Eye Open. Oculi do not need to sleep, but must enter a resting state for 8 hours to benefit from a long rest. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as though you were awake. Oculus Perception. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check using sight, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, even if you are not normally proficient. Telepathy. You can speak telepathically to creatures within 60 feet of you. For a creature to understand your telepathy, you must share a language. You perform the verbal components of spells by broadcasting them to all creatures within range of your telepathy. Languages. Oculi can’t physically speak, but communicate telepathically. They can “speak,” read, and write Common and one other language of your choice, usually the language of a society near to the watch into which you were born. Subrace. Three main evolutionary functions of oculi make up oculus society: the Oculus Adjudicate, the Oculus Inquisitive, and the Oculus Vigilant. Choose one of these subraces.

They have no lands to call their home and fight to maintain any comfort or routine they've claimed for themselves. Ogres are even forsaken by the god of the giants, and languish below hill giants at the bottom of their social structure. There's more to the ogre's story when the layers are peeled back. Ogres stand nearly ten feet tall and their skin tones trend towards pale yellows, greens, browns, and purples. They possess an incredibly intricate musculature, allowing them to express a variety of subtle feelings and expressions that words can’t capture. Their bodies burn energy at a breakneck pace, and many ogres need twelve hours of sleep to stay healthy (though adventuring ogres learn to adapt to the sleeping schedules of their fellow party members). Ogre families typically stay small to make the best use of resources around them. However, some ogres settle within big gnome societies, offering the gnomes protection and helping with their infrastructure efforts. Ogres often take up performative wrestling, firework tossing, and the culinary arts when their needs are met. Ogres have a unique emotion for setting off on adventure best described as a \"happy frown.\" Little can stop an ogre from going after big dreams.

It don’t get shadier than this.” - Plens Donsu’us, Barista, Wizards of the Roast Those who wander the Shadow Plane are doomed to twisted fates and mired minds. These fading, lost souls begin to manifest monstrous forms, although some especially resilient individuals manage to pull themselves from this dark path before their essence is wiped clean. Known as ombrasks (OM-brask), these translucent creatures hail from a variety of heritages; from elf to dwarf, dragonborn to lotol, and rakin to goblin. All struggle to recall even the simplest memory, such as their former name, and all have a ghostly, colourless appearance. Shadow Memories One of the first things an ombrask forgets is its voice. Though it knows and can understand the meaning of words, its cadence, pitch, and patterns of speech fade from lack of use; the dreary, joyless experience of the Shadow Plane leaves little to talk about. However, ombrasks become especially sensitive to the psychic burst of emotion that accompanies death, the freeing of a soul from its shadow-numbed body. Ombrasks can latch onto the shreds of this psyche and adopt its speech patterns, learning to mimic them perfectly. Next lost is the ability to feel, love, and smile; any emotion associated with joy or excitement is nullified. With prolonged distance from the Shadow Plane, or exposure to realms of strong emotion, such as the Plane of Fey or Springarden, these sensations can make a slow return for a lucky few. What is never lost is the memory of mundane tasks, such as ploughing, chopping wood, or polishing armour. Muscle memory is scarred into the minds of ombrasks, making them particularly deft at tiny, detailed work. Almost Unseen If an ombrask doesn’t find a way to exit the Shadow Plane or isn’t summoned by some novice wizard, it can fade entirely, becoming an invisible, skulking creature bent only on survival. In fact, there is strong evidence to suggest that the creature summoned by the unseen servant spell is one of these invisible creatures, temporarily pulled from the Shadow Plane. The fate of those too far gone is enough to stop most explorers from staying long in that dull and lifeless expanse. Momento A sense of adventure, a magical mishap, or a cruel curse, there are a multitude of reasons why a native of the Material Plane might find itself shunned to the Shadow Plane. Discovering who they used to be is a motivator for many ombrasks. Do they have parents? Cultural traditions? What is their history? On the other hand, some ombrasks, perhaps those with a foreboding sense of their past misdeeds, choose to ignore what might have come before and focus on living life anew. That is, if their previous life doesn’t come calling… Ombrask Traits As an ombrask, you have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and one other ability score based on your former race increases by 1, as described in the table below. Ombrask Former Race Boons Former Race Ability Increased Cnidaran +1 Con Cyclopian +1 Int Dwarf +1 Con Elf +1 Int, Wis, or Cha Dragonborn +1 Str Gnome +1 Int Gobboc +1 Wis or Cha Golynn +1 Con Half-Elf +1 Cha Half-Orc +1 Str Halfling +1 Cha Human +1 any ability except Dex Oozekin +1 Con Opteran +1 Cha Rakin +1 Con, Int, Wis, or Cha* Tiefling +1 Cha *Choose one that the rakin subrace had a choice of. Age . Ombrasks live as long as the race from which they originated. Languages . You can read and write Common and Undercommon, but can speak only using your Voice Thief feature. Size . Ombrasks retain the general shape of their former race. Your size is either Medium or Small, based on your former race. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet . Darkvision . Accustomed to life on the Shadow Plane, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey. Fade Away . When you reach 5th level, you can cast the invisibility spell on yourself once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Lightbender. Light naturally sculpts around your skin. You have advantage on saving throws against being blinded, and you have resistance to radiant damage. Trackless . The Shadow Plane is a dangerous place and ombrasks quickly learn to move in the shadows, leaving scarce tracks in their wake. You have proficiency in the Stealth skill. Voice Thief. While an ombrask can potentially understand any number of languages, it is a naturally mute creature. When a creature that can speak dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to absorb a piece of its psyche. After you have used this reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. After you have absorbed a psyche, you can perfectly mimic the creature’s voice, cadence, and speech patterns indefinitely. You can hold a number of pieces of psyche (and mimic a number of voices) equal to your proficiency bonus. If absorbing a new piece of psyche would put you over this limit, you must choose one psyche to be replaced.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Loot Tavern","book":"Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting - Compendium"},{"name":"One-And-A-Halfling","description":"Every five hundred years, a halfling experiences a phenomenon shared by few others before them: a growth spurt.

I should really watch what I drink.” - Dr. Stein, Data Log 0290 Naturally curious, oozekin (OOZE-kin) do not have a culture of their own; instead, they tend to assimilate with whoever is ready to accept their slimy, invertebrate form. From the bodyguards of mighty, stone-willed nobles, to adopted playmates of excitable halflings, oozekin are found everywhere, though in small numbers. Taking on the values of those that surround them, oozekin are hard to pigeonhole and have but one thing in common: a delight in immersing their new-found consciousness in the habits and customs of other sapient creatures. Biomantic Origins Oozekin are the odd by-products of Dr Stein’s biomancy experiments—biomantic oozes that gained consciousness and self-replicate through asexual reproduction. When the time is right, an oozekin produces a larval sludge: a juvenile, biomantically-altered ooze not dissimilar to those one might find in a dungeon. After this larva consumes enough sentient grey matter, it exhibits a sudden cognitive and physiological metamorphosis, rising as a humanoid-shaped oozekin. These unmoulded, newly-formed consciousnesses are extremely susceptible to the psyches of creatures near them both in space and time. An oozekin that develops in the former lair of a red dragon might take on its avaricious and arrogant personality traits, while one that forms near a sleeping adventurer might be filled with wanderlust and risk-taking qualities. Indeed, the grey matter that a biomantic ooze consumes can have a significant influence on the subsequent oozekin’s values, habits, and memories. Tales abound of oozey doppelgangers, facsimiles of fallen adventurers that believe themselves to be the deceased creature reborn. . Oozey Re-birth If a player character dies in an area rich with biomancy, you can consider allowing their character to be reborn as an oozekin. A biomantic ooze may well consume the grey matter of their brain and adopt a plethora of their personality traits, memories, and class levels Willing and Able Relatively new to the world, oozekin are keen to prove themselves the equal of any other race. Though most oozekin exist within the framework of other, established civilisations, pods of oozekin settlements have arisen in corners of The Low. These conglomerations mix the various assimilated cultures and traditions each oozekin has experienced or formed with, often with unpredictable consequences. Luckily, oozekin’s propensity to get along with one another has resulted in the reconciliation of schisms between historically antagonistic races, such as grey dwarves and dark elves, even if only vicariously through their oozekin adoptees. Most oozekin are more than happy to fulfil their role as helpful and productive citizens, contributing to society in any way they can. Others, perhaps those that accidentally harmed friends with their acidic skin, go to obscene lengths to disguise their true form, covering themselves head to toe in scraps of clothing, never staying in one place too long. An especially curious and introspective few live to discover the reason for their existence. How come they have no parents? Where is their history? Why do they exist? Oozekin Traits As an oozekin, you have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1. Age . An oozekin’s age is nearly impossible to discern. However, the compounds that sustain them appear to deteriorate quickly after 70 years. Creature Type . You are a humanoid. You are also considered an ooze for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an ooze. Languages . You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Size . Your size can be Medium or Small. If you are Small, you grow to Medium size over 2d4 days. When you are Medium, you can use an action to discard a piece of yourself to become Small. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet . Darkvision . Accustomed to life in dark, wet caverns, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey. Acidic Flesh . You have resistance to acid damage, and you know the acid splash cantrip. If you cast the spell targeting a creature you’re currently grappling or grappled by, the target automatically fails its saving throw. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Reshapeable. Starting at 3rd level you can, as an action, alter your body to assume the form of a cube or a puddle for up to 1 hour . After you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. While in either of these forms, you can’t talk; manipulate objects; make attacks; or cast spells. You can end this effect early as an action. The form you assume has the following effects: Cube Form . Your walking speed is halved and your body becomes a 5-foot cube. You can safely store any items you are carrying, holding, or wearing in a vesicle within your body. Creatures directly behind you have three-quarters cover against attacks that originate on the opposite side of you. You also gain a new action option, the Engulf action: Engulf. You move up to your speed and can attempt to move into the space of one creature of equal or smaller size than you, which must make a Dexterity saving throw ( DC = 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failure, if you aren’t already grappling a creature, the creature becomes grappled by you. While grappled in this way, the creature is restrained and takes acid damage at the start of each of its turns as if it had failed a saving throw against your acid splash cantrip. On a success, you expend the movement but remain in the space from which your movement originated. Puddle Form. Your walking speed is halved as you collapse into a 5-foot-diameter pool. You can’t hold or carry items and any objects you are holding, carrying, or wearing when you transform fall to the ground in your space. While in this form, attack rolls by creatures further than 5 feet away from you have disadvantage to hit you, you non-magically gain the benefits of the spider climb spell, and you can travel through spaces as small as 1 inch wide without squeezing.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Loot Tavern","book":"Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting - Compendium"},{"name":"Opteran","description":"“Oh, he’s an absolute delight to have around. Just wish he would stop running into the glowglobe.” - Lux Lumin, half-elf Wizard Adventurer A sedentary life among the birds and insects of their treetop dwellings is the most adventurous goal of many opterans’ lives. In shades of green and brown, these larval opterans (OP-ter-an) are happy to avoid conflict, camouflaging into the canopy from which they acquire sustenance. But, with a brilliant flash of colour, an adult opteran injects this placid scene with a vivacious zest for life. Frantic flaps of its broad, multicoloured wings usher this metamorphosed form to and fro, a sparkling rainbow that nary takes a moment to rest. Live Fast, Die Young Opterans can, in theory, live forever. So long as they are never stressed (and have no goals for reproduction), a larval opteran doesn’t age and can enjoy an indefinite life of sedentary bliss. However, should the need arise, such as during times of environmental catastrophe, war, or fits of passion, a larval opteran enters a chrysalis in which it metamorphoses into its winged, adult form. Once it emerges, the clock begins ticking; it lives no more than 2 or 3 years in this form, just long enough to find a mate and produce a new batch of larvae elsewhere in the world. Because of this, larval opterans are extremely conflict-averse. If a predator comes a-calling, a larval opteran prefers to deploy its sticky ‘string shot’ and retreat to the safety of its tree-home, rather than potentially become overstimulated. Conversely, adult, winged opterans often lose this sense of self-preservation, a behaviour change that the uneducated might describe as ‘disturbing’. Natural Performers Due to their brilliant colouration and short lives, opterans make some of the most renowned performers. Tales are told of the bard group Wings of a Butterfly’s first and final world tour. So in-demand were tickets to this once-in-their-lifetime show, that monarchs even traded small earldoms in order to purchase a show for their courts. Opterans that choose to venture into the wider world are often old, tired of the sedentary life, and ready for adventure. However, the destruction of an opteran’s home, the search for a loved one, or the desire to be the next Wings of a Butterfly could all be worthy motivators to risk undergoing the change . Opteran Traits As an opteran, you have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Charisma score increases by 2. Age . Opterans age based on their environment. They can live for centuries in their larval forms, but under great stress, they pupate and hatch into their adult forms. Tragically, they only live for 2 to 3 years after emerging as adults. Creature Type . You are a humanoid. You are also considered a fey for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a fey. Languages . You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Size . Larval opterans stand between 2 and 3 feet tall, while adult opterans are between 5 to 6 feet. Your size begins as Small. When you become an adult opteran, you grow to Medium size. See the Metamorphosis trait for details. Speed . Your base walking speed as a larval opteran is 25 feet . Your base walking speed as an adult opteran is 30 feet . Metamorphosis . At 1st level, you are a larval opteran. When you reach 5th level, you can choose to undergo a metamorphosis over the course of 24 hours . After this period elapses, you emerge as an adult opteran: you lose the Many-Footed and String Shot traits, and you gain the Flight and Radiant Wing traits. You can delay this change until you reach 6th level, at which point it happens spontaneously. Many-Footed (Larval Form Only). Having many legs and a low centre of gravity gives you extraordinary balance. You have advantage on ability checks made to maintain your balance and on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid the prone condition. String Shot (Larval Form Only). As an action, you can fire a torrent of sticky string at a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw ( DC equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or become restrained for 1 minute . A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against the aforementioned DC , freeing itself or a restrained creature within its reach on a success. You can use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Flight (Adult Form Only). As an adult opteran, you have a flying speed of 20 feet . To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armour. Radiant Wing (Adult Form Only). Those wings would dazzle any performance. You have advantage on all Charisma checks.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Loot Tavern","book":"Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting - Compendium"},{"name":"Orc","description":"Orc Traits Your orc character has the following racial traits.

And just like that, the proud, pinstriped hot rod of a ship was unveiled for what it really was: cogs, pistons, gears, and belts, to say nothing of the grease. She smiled at this. It was more honest, and more accepting of the work. With a few more tune-ups, it’d be the fastest rig in the quadrant, maybe in the ‘verse. — Dame’re Krath, orc mechanic, modifying her ram rod Orcs are muscular, down-to-earth humanoids with green skin and imposing builds. Despite their reputation, few races in the ‘verse are quite as good with a wrench or as quick with a comeback. Pragmatic Orcs tend to be practical, common sense folks, who believe the best solution to a problem is one that works. Fixing machines and fiddling with hardware comes naturally to them, partially because an orcish preteen can lift an engine block, and partially because they find something satisfying in tools that have a purpose and machines that work well. Most orc technology has developed according to the, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mindset, which has led to some truly unique designs. Their ships, which they usually call “rigs” or “rides”, are powered by gasoline, and feature impressive exhaust pipes and air intakes. It’s not uncommon to see one painted with pinstripes, flames, or entire murals. Likewise, their blasters still retain the trappings of ammunition-based guns, with magazines and prominent muzzles. Many orcs take great pride in a well-oiled, finely tuned rig, especially if they've built it themselves. If an orc mechanic isn't fiddling with the engine of their rig until it hums, they're polishing the chassis or detailing the interior. Truly, the end result is a thing of beauty: a ship that is equal parts classic style and extraordinary engineering. Aftermath of War While history remembers the Warzone as being the consequence of a great orcish war, modern orcs remember almost nothing about the conflict. Their old national identities, on which the war originally centered, have been washed away with centuries of arcane warheads and goblinoid alliances, and those few which can escape the Warzone would rather pretend it didn’t happen. They carry their history and culture with them, and feel a pang for the war that took their homeworld, but claim little responsibility for the violence of the Warzone today. Orcs of the ‘verse have undergone a diaspora since losing their homeworld. A surprising number have ended up in the dwarven conclave as full citizens, and nearly as many have taken up residence in the Lakshay garrison. These orcs outside the warzone usually claim the nationalities of their adopted homes, and are welcomed in kind. Inside the warzone, however, orcs live among hobgoblin warchiefs which would conscript them into battle, and gnoll marauders which would raid their homes. As such, their life is a migratory one, whether fleeing the violence or pursuing it. Orc Names Many orcs have names derived from the hard consonants of their ancestral language, but many more adopt names from other races. It’s rare, however, to see an orc with a particularly elaborate or ostentatious name. Male Orc Names. Grax, Midor, Oliggon, Renk, Sared, Throg, Vrok Female Orc Names.

On some worlds, such as Eberron, orcs were among the first defenders of the natural order from the encroachments of Fiends and other extraplanar threats.

Though scholars only suspect it, and every dwarf would savagely deny it, the orcs and the dwarves share a common elder fey lineage. In the prehistory of the Kaladrun Mountains, the dwarves who would become the orcs settled in the north. Though they did not suspect it, they dwelled too close to the home of Izrador, and over the centuries, he corrupted their people to his cause. Orcs are huge beings, sometimes twice the size of their dwarf ancestors and bigger even than the Dorns. They are heavily muscled, with broad builds and powerful limbs. Their thick hides are tough and range from light flint gray to a deep slate. Their hair is tawny and mane-like, growing over their heads, along their spines, and down their chests to their groins. Their large black eyes are hooded and protected by thick, bony brows. Their jaws are large and strong, with tusklike lower canines. In the lands of the far north, most of orc society has been shaped by the will of Izrador for thousands of years. Instead of communities or families, orcs live in violent warbands known as legions, each ruled by the female priest-leaders known as the kurastch udareen, “the mother-wives of Izrador.” Life in the legions is specifically designed to produce the most bloodthirsty killers for Izrador’s armies. As soon as children are old enough to clutch a rock, they are pitted against one another in violent blood sports. The strongest ascend to lead gangs of their peers, while the weak are killed. The gangs roam the desolate northlands by night, slaying any animal (or lone orc) that crosses their path. Once they’ve seen their tenth winter, young orcs are taken into the ranks of one of their legion’s many “spears,” squads of roughly ten warriors, where through brutal discipline they are beaten into some semblance of soldiers. Their cultivated aggression is barely held in check by the strength of their superiors, and infighting and even outright wars against other legions can consume much of a legion’s strength. This suits the Shadow perfectly, as it ensures no one leader emerges amongst the legions who might challenge the rule of the legates or even Izrador himself. And, after all, there are always more orcs to refill the ranks. In conquered Erenland, orcs have taken over human cities, turning large buildings into meeting halls, communal barracks, and storage depots. They feed and resupply from the tribute they demand of the subjugated peoples around them. Orc forces are garrisoned in cites throughout Erenland, and orc armies war with the elves in the west and the dwarves in the east. Large orc patrols range across the heartland, subjugating their human thralls and hunting spies, smugglers, and insurgents. In short, they are seen by most as the enemies of all other people of Eredane. However, this is not always the case. Some orcs rebel against the lives they lead. Perhaps they harbor a powerful grudge against an orc captain or legate, and that grudge leads them to abandon Izrador’s service. Others may reject being one more disposable pawn in the Shadow’s armies and strike out for themselves. Some orcs see past a lifetime of vicious and merciless conditioning and choose to stand against cruelty and injustice. And a few see Izrador’s plans for what they truly are, and choose to stand against the eventual destruction of all life everywhere. In many cases, these orcs have little choice but to obey their leaders or suffer the same fate as all those who resist Izrador’s will. On some occasions, however, these orcs find themselves in a position to escape the army and to try to make a new life elsewhere. Such orcs are often turned in by citizens bent on revenge for the mistreatment of their people, but not always. Orc warriors, whether servants of the Shadow or hunted by their own kind, take great pride in their fighting prowess. Amongst the armies of Izrador, it is traditional to add a scarred mark on their arm for each foe they kill in battle. The arms of warlords are usually covered in such marks from hand to shoulder, and at least half the marks are for killing other orcs. Orcs favor large spears they can both throw and use as thrusting weapons. They also carry heavy iron swords called vardatches, which have blunt but serrated edges. These weapons are slow but brutal and so heavy that the smaller fey peoples can hardly lift them. Orcs Against the Shadow Izrador considers those orcs who leave his service to be the greatest threat to his conquest of Eredane. He has commanded his legates to hunt down any orc who leaves the legions. Even more telling is the order that such orcs be quickly and quietly eliminated. While the Shadow is happy to rely on public executions to cow the oppressed populace of Eredane, Izrador fears (if fear is possible for a god) revealing that it is possible for orcs to abandon his service and think for themselves. Too much of his control of occupied Eredane relies on keeping the orc legions and oppressed people locked in eternal and mutual hatred. The legates take to hunting rogue orcs with gusto. Witch takers are often pulled away from their duties and dispatched to track down deserters in the legions, and the Conclave of Tender Mercies prowls at the edges of the legion warrens, searching for signs of dissent and dispatching their astirax servants to spy upon the kurasatch udareen. Of course, the legions do not appreciate this suspicion, and unwary legates may end up butchered by vardatches and buried in the warren’s deepest crypts. This infighting reaches the highest levels of the Shadow’s army; the Night King Sunulael insidiously suggests that his hordes of undead could replace the orc legions, while Othaeron violently objects to the idea and insists his armies are the backbone of the Shadow’s rule. So far, these divisions have been mostly hidden from the enemies of the Shadow. However, little escapes the eyes of the Witch Queen. Aradil and her Council are aware of the growing trickle of deserters from the orc legions, even if most elves are not. So far they are unsure as to the best way to exploit this vulnerability, since most orc legionaries remain indoctrinated into the worship of the Shadow. If they learned of the existence of groups like the Followers of the True Mother, perhaps they could reach out to form a secret alliance right in the heart of the enemy. In the meantime, however, the best chance to spread the word of dissent within the orc legions comes from the individual orc deserters. Unfortunately, they are unreliable ambassadors at best. Many orcs who leave the legions do not do so out of any idealistic motive. They simply want to escape the unrelenting harsh violence of life in Izrador’s armies, where the most they can expect is an early death. These orcs are more likely to form bands of bandits or mercenaries living in the wilds and preying on isolated communities just as often as they attack legion supply convoys. For the peoples of Eredane, these orcs are not much better than the orc legionaries who enforce Izrador’s rule. But sometimes isolated farmsteads can work out uneasy truces with these deserter bands to mutual aid, providing food and shelter in exchange for protection against the Fell and marauding slavers. Of course, those orcs who best demonstrate that their people are not simply unthinking killers are those who join the various resistance groups scattered across Eredane. These orcs can become vital allies in the fight against the Shadow. Most tend to be strong and fierce warriors, of course. However, their knowledge of the legions’ operations is even more useful, and their ability to infiltrate the legions can be invaluable for a clever band or resistance fighters. The smartest resistance leaders know that the sight of an orc killing guards and freeing enslaved captives can start a firestorm of rumors and stories across Eredane that no amount of effort from the legates could stamp out.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon’s teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness. Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age: The Ghaash’kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the “binding flame”), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call of Kalok Shash and join the Ghaash’kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there. The Jhorash’tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare. The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs. Orcs of the Shadow Marches The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr’s corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. Orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides. Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers. When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration. Leaving the Shadow Marches d8 Reason for Leaving 1 You’re associated with the Gatekeepers, and you’re on a quest to combat a daelkyr-related threat beyond the bounds of the Shadow Marches. 2 House Tharashk recruited you from the Marches to serve as a mercenary in the Last War. 3 You’re a simple hunter, but you’ve decided to seek your fortune or a real challenge in the world beyond the Marches. 4 Your village was destroyed by monsters from Droaam, so you’re looking for a new place in the world. 5 As a cultist of the Dragon Below, you believe that slaying powerful foes is the only way to earn your passage to the paradise that lies deep within the hollow world. You’ve ventured beyond the Marches in search of worthy enemies. 6 Your clan works with House Tharashk, and you’ve been recruited as a bounty hunter or investigator even though you’re not a member of the house. 7 The leader of your clan committed a great wrong against another clan, which has now sworn to exterminate every last member of your clan. What better time to see the world? 8 Your work as an investigator has set you upon a trail of mysteries that leads far beyond the Marches. Half-Orcs of Khorvaire With the rise of the dragonmarked House Tharashk, orcs and half-orcs have spread through the Five Nations and beyond. In general, the people of the Five Nations know little about half-orcs. When people imagine a half-orc, they usually think of a Tharashk bounty hunter or dogged inquisitive, but a few ignorant sorts might still hold the stereotype of a “simpleton from the swamps.” Half-Orcs and Dragonmarks The Mark of Finding appears among half-orcs and humans of House Tharashk. Strangely, orcs associated with the house cannot develop this mark. Dragonmarked half-orcs work extensively with humans, orcs, and unmarked half-orcs in pursuit of the house’s mission of bounty hunting, inquisitive work, and prospecting. Across Khorvaire, anyone who wants to find something or someone turns to House Tharashk. Orc Traits An orc character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase.

Orcs are one of Exandria’s youngest races, and are said to have been born from elves seared by the blood of Gruumsh, the Ruiner, when Corellon pierced the orc god’s eye on the field of battle. For long years, orcs were feared as mindless abominations, drawn to slaughter like moths to flame. Stories tell of how the blood of the Ruiner flows in the veins of all orcs, driving them to commit acts of terrible violence and anger. Orcs call this fury hgar’Gruum, or the curse of ruin, and use it to refer to everything from battle rage to a bad temper. Half-orcs are said to have inherited the blood of the Ruiner, and to carry the same bloodlust and fury that orcs do. Orcs and half-orcs do feel a certain pull toward violence and anger. But the simple truth is that there is no curse of ruin. No supernatural power drives orcs to kill. Rather, they are simply victims of the same selfish, violent impulses that corrupt all mortal beings. Half-Orcs in the Dwendalian Empire The orcish settlement of Bladegarden was incorporated into the Dwendalian Empire after the fall of the Julous Dominion, nearly three hundred years ago. Orcs are now renowned as some of the empire’s most accomplished soldiers, though many folk still fear the ancient legends of the curse of ruin. Half-orcs are proud of their heritage, though many are wary of the wrathful curse that supposedly drives them to violence. Those who embrace this gift of fury often enlist in the Righteous Brand to focus their rage against the enemies of the empire. Other half-orcs reject the idea that they are destined for violence, and rely on faith, meditation, and friendship to live peaceful lives. Half-Orcs on the Menagerie Coast The folk of the Clovis Concord welcome people of all kinds to their shores, yet orcs and half-orcs are uncommon in Concordian cities. Most half-orcs on the Menagerie Coast come from the continent of Tal’Dorei as visitors, merchants, or mercenaries, and rarely settle. Half-orc children in the settlements of the coast are often bullied for their unusual teeth. Only the Concordian city of Othe has a significant half-orc population. Originally established as a spiritual site for the Ki’Nau people, the city has long attracted orcs and half-orcs who believe that the curse of ruin has caused them to lash out at those they love. In Othe, they find peace through spiritualism—and a place to belong. Half-Orcs in Xhorhas The orcs of Xhorhas are a predominantly nomadic people, living in mixed clans of orcs, humans, and bugbears. They wander the wastes, taming the indigenous beasts and trading with Kryn settlements. The relationship between the orcs and the Kryn is relatively peaceful, though many nomadic orcs are angered when Kryn souls are reborn in orc bodies. These orcs nonetheless readily accept Kryn into their roving clans, seeing it as a point of pride that a city dweller has been drawn to a more exciting life in the chaos of the wastes. Most half-orcs in Xhorhas have human or drow blood. In the culture of the Xhorhasian nomads, the union of orcs and goblinkin is strictly taboo, for the clans’ elders fear the uncontrolled madness of a soul afflicted by both Gruumsh’s curse of ruin and Bane’s curse of strife.

Creating Your Character If you create an owlin character, follow these additional rules during character creation. Ability Score Increases When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You’re free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20. Languages Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player’s Handbook offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign. Creature Type Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters, including owlin, are of the Humanoid type. Creature types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the cure wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn’t work on a creature that has the Construct type. Life Span The typical life span of a player character in D&D is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Height and Weight Player characters, including owlin, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player’s Handbook , and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character. Owlin Distant kin of giant owls from the Feywild, owlin come in many shapes and sizes, from petite and fluffy to wide-winged and majestic. Owlin have arms and legs like other Humanoids, as well as wings that extend from their back and shoulders. Like owls, owlin are graced with feathers that make no sound when they move or fly, making it easy for them to sneak up on you in the library. Your owlin character might be nocturnal. Or perhaps your character is simply prone to rise later, embodying the common nickname of night owl. Owlin Traits You have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of yourself as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray. Flight.

You have proficiency in the Stealth skill.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Strixhaven A Curriculum of Chaos"},{"name":"Phaenec","description":"The dark-skinned Phaenec are a nomadic race living in the Ember Wastelands of Ashandri. Their ancestors were regular humans. Some day they met a friendly tribe of humanoid desert fox spirits, the Faradhin. Friendship turned into romance, and over time, a new race evolved. For generations, Phaenec and spirits lived together in harmony. But one day, the fox spirits were gone - with no traces of what had happened to them. Not even powerful spellcasters managed to find them anymore. Most Phaenec have given up hope, but a few still try to find the Faradhin. Despite the loss of their friends and lovers, the Phaenec retained their spiritual lifestyle. They are deeply attuned to the harsh desert. The tribes believe that the land itself has a soul, and the more you understand it, the more you thrive. Even other native races like the Ember Orcs struggle in the open desert. But for the Phaenec, the Ember Wastelands are more than just their home. They call it Akhavi, which translates into Loving Nourisher. Somehow, the Phaenec always find the food and even healing plants that they need. And it’s no secret that they can summon the desert itself to fight their enemies. The apocalypse was disastrous for this race. Not all of the old queendom of Larysh was saved, and most Phaenec lived in a region that was entirely destroyed. Only three tribes survived, with no more than a few hundred members each. And even those were decimated further during the first invasion of Va’Laeth. About half of the original survivors were killed in the battles, and the Phaenec are at the brink of extinction. Some of them think they should leave their desert home, and spread into the world. Others are convinced that now, more than ever, the Phaenec have to stick together. Despite these conflicts, they are united in their beliefs: Everything in nature has a soul, and all souls are equal. In such a world, everything deserves respect, even if it appears dead or inanimate. That also means that all Phaenec consider themselves worthy of respect, and they demand it where necessary. Phaenec Warriors About 20% of all Phaenec become warriors, protectors of the tribe. It’s a free choice open to any member of the tribe. They are called Threndavi, which translates into Loving Shield. The Threndavi choose their own mentors from among the other warriors, and taking in a student is considered an honor for the teacher. Every Threndavi receives a Ma’Aru, one of the golden armors of the Phaenec. The warriors are trained to use the reflecting surface to their advantage, blinding their opponents with sunlight. The armor remains property of the tribe, and if the warrior ever leaves the tribe's vicinity, they have to give it back until they return. A Threndavi Phaenec Warrior Phaenec language The Phaenec tribes speak Phaenon, a purely oral language. They have no recorded history, and their language has no concepts of time. To them, everything is in the present, even if it happened already - or not yet. Most Phaenec also learn Common so they can interact with other races. Many of them struggle with writing, and only a few have mastered the concept of different times. Most Phaenec change the tenses randomly as they speak Common, and even if they try hard, they occasionally switch between past, present and future. Phaenec Names Phaenec names are based on the Phaenon language. Names tend to use mostly soft sounds, and rarely have more than two syllables. The Phaenec don't have family names. As tribes are relatively small, names aren't used twice within a tribe. Female Phaenec names: Ashi, Bara, Gyva, Lajj, Ra, Shaez, Silid Male Phaenec names: Dhis, Djawajj, Mat, Mavi, Naqa, Ubar Traits Ability Score Increase: Wisdom+2, Charisma+1 Age: Phaenec are considered mature at about 18 years, and often live up to 130-140 years. Alignment: Most Phaenec are good or neutral. Evil individuals are usually banished from a tribe, unless they hide their deeds well. Size: Phaenec are usually a bit smaller than humans. Their size ranges from barely five to almost six feet, but most of them are in the smaller spectrum of this range. Their size category is medium. Languages: Phaenec have their own language, Phaenon, which has no written version. You can also read and write Common. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Heightened Senses: You have Proficiency on Perception checks based on sound. Spirit Flame: Calling upon your spirit ancestors, you can cast Sacred Flame twice for 1d8 radiant damage. You regain the ability to cast it after finishing a long rest. Grasp of the Desert: Beginning at 3rd level, you can summon the very ground you walk upon to help you in battle. You can cast Entangle as a first-level spell once, but instead of weed and vines, the soil or sand from the ground rises on your command. This counts as a material component needed for the spell to work, which is not consumed by the spell. If there is no soil or sand, you can summon these elemental forces from as much as a pouch of sand. Your spell save DC for this ability is 8 + your Proficiency modifier + your Wisdom modifier. You regain the ability to cast it after finishing a long rest. Wisdom is your Spellcasting ability for this spell. Nomadic attunement: Beginning at 5th level, you can call upon your spirit heritage to cast Locate Animals or Plants once. The Phaenec can use their own fur as a material component for this spell. You regain the ability to cast it after finishing a long rest.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Piney","description":"When did our ways become so old? A stump, a frog, a flowr’ unfold, I heard em’ call us worse than sin, The forest was deep ‘for we slipped in, The shadows were here ‘for we slipped in. Many villages scattered through the Margreve are home to an elusive species of humanoids known as the pineys. These strange beings are followers of a superstitious code known to outsiders as “the old ways,” though the pineys themselves do not refer to it as such. For them, the rules of the Margreve are as natural as the leaves growing on the boughs above. On occasion, and likely caused by banishment arising from actions contrary to the old ways, a piney leaves the limits of the Margreve. These cast-outs soon lose the extreme features of their kind, reverting to a more human form. However, the magic of the great forest still courses through their blood, manifesting in strange and sometimes dreadful ways. Shadows of the Margreve While the pineys were once human, their bodies have been changed by the magic of the great forest over the generations. When a piney leaves the Margreve, the forest’s influence fades but never fully disappears. Their too-long limbs and blank inchoate eyes suggest a fey influence, but their kind is also known for strange plant-like qualities to their skin, hair, and nails. For this reason, pineys prefer wearing scarves and hoods to hide their true faces. Pineys do not recognize gender and are utterly unconcerned with prescriptive roles based on arbitrary physical characteristics. When a piney wishes to reproduce, the magic of the Margreve allows the piney to alter its form as required to ensure successful reproduction. Godless Pineys do not worship the gods or their masks. Prayer is strictly forbidden and is seen as an expression of the outsiders’ moral inferiority. Pineys who are caught worshipping gods are swiftly banished from their villages. While the pineys revere the forest, they do so not from a desire to approach the divine, but from an absolute and practical surety that their continued existence depends on the enigmatic will of Midgard’s oldest forest. The ceremonies and sacrifices made in the name of the Margreve have a religious outward appearance, but in fact they are very pragmatic—without occasional blood sacrifices, the forest punishes them. Pineys do not innately understand concepts such as spirituality and faith. Suspicious of Magic and Outsiders Pineys generally view spells as either signs of the gods meddling in the natural world or the product of evil beings attempting trickery. Magic from druids and rangers are common exceptions to this superstition, though some piney villages still outlaw such magic just like any other magic. More commonly, piney magic is concerned with the construction of small fetishes or jewelry made from natural material. The act of making these charms is in fact its own kind of magic, and the resulting creations are often enchanted by the piney’s innate connection to the natural world. Pineys sometimes trade the less powerful charms for goods not commonly found in the Margreve. Examples of these charms can be found in the Magic Items chapter. Pineys tend toward suspicion of outsiders, and their interaction with the other folk of Midgard is extremely limited. Late at night along the great trade road north of the forest, cloaked pineys sometimes appear with coin and crafted charms to trade for salt and iron. These ambassadors make their trades quickly and with obvious discomfort. Life in the Forest Piney villages are located deep in the Margreve forest. Though their homes evoke human architecture, the villages are often melded into the trunks of trees or dug into the side of grassy hills. A piney village is a foreboding place with strange symbols etched into the wooden walls of the darkened homes. From these enclaves, pineys patrol their territory from dusk until sunrise ensuring the woods are safe and free from interlopers. Pineys feed through photosynthesis, which often requires them to chase patches of sunlight throughout the day before returning to their villages for a few hours of rest. Way of the Woods Pineys follow an unspoken series of social contracts which outsiders refer to as the “old ways.” These rules are learned by young pineys through cautionary tales told by village elders, and through accidental infractions which are quickly corrected. The “old ways” are generally centered around respecting the Margreve’s power, honoring the memories which lie in the forest’s loamy floor, and making the required sacrifices to ensure the village remains in good standing with the creatures and spirits beyond the village’s borders. A Piney Abroad A piney who leaves the Margreve, either by choice or by banishment, quickly reverts to a more human form. The magic of the ancient forest fades, allowing them to stand straighter, speak in a clearer voice, and behave in a manner less directed by the “old ways.” Despite the loosening of the forest’s grip, a piney always retains some portion of the Margreve’s magic. This most often manifests in physical qualities which can be hard to disguise. Pineys abroad tend to live in small, agricultural communities, and many find they are capable guardians of the small villages they inhabit. They are slow to warm to strangers, though fiercely loyal to friends and family. Pineys leave the Margreve only when they have a strong motivation to do so. Piney Language Pineys speak their own language. It mixes many Elvish words with a vocal approximation of the sounds heard in the forest. Some pineys speak a rough form of Common which is taught to individuals destined to trade with the outside world. Piney Names Pineys abandoned the naming conventions of outsiders centuries ago. There are no names which are distinctly male or female among the pineys, who declare their own names each Spring. It is not uncommon for a piney to have had a different name for each year it has lived. Piney names evoke the sounds, colors, flora, and fauna of the Margreve without relying on distinct words. A piney name is an act of play; it has a musical quality and is sometimes onomatopoeic for a common forest sound. The names of piney villages, on the other hand, follow a very strict set of conventions which honors the oldest tree standing within five miles. If the tree dies, the village name is changed to include the next oldest – in this way, piney villages may have the same name for centuries then go through a period of frequent change. The names are often one or two elvish words that describe the most prominent feature of the tree honored by the village. Though simple, these words carry great weight in their villages and anyone dishonoring the village’s namesake is severely punished. Individual Names: Whihop, Caw, Sususus, Hoom, Whiii, Oaungoaung, Brbl, Kikoko, Auur Village Names: Iai, Ilias, Oiroa, Thyoli, Aidren, Inianto, Asaca Piney Traits Your piney character has traits which are common to any piney who has left the Margreve for an extended period of time. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Pineys have the same lifespans as humans, reaching maturity in their late teens. Alignment. Pineys living in their villages follow their own code diligently. They owe no allegiance to the gods, nor do they aspire to being paragons of good or evil. Pineys who leave the Margreve tend to have respect for laws, but they struggle to adopt moral stances. For these reasons, pineys tend towards lawful and neutral alignments. Size. Like humans, pineys vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Margreve Within. As a piney adventuring beyond the Margreve, you have lost the more extreme, occasionally monstrous, qualities of your forest-dwelling kin. Nonetheless, the magic of the elder forest marks you. You can meet your daily alimentary needs by consuming a suitable amount of food or by standing in direct sunlight for 30 minutes. In addition, your organs are partially made from plant matter. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. Margreve Without. Regardless of the time and distance between you and the Margreve, the forest’s influence on you manifests in the form of strange alterations to your body. Although you are humanoid, your connection to the Margreve marks you with plant‑like characteristics. Create a growth of your own in consultation with your GM or pick one from the following list: Your skin is rough with harmless cracks resembling tree bark. Heavily-perfumed flowers grow wherever your body hair is dense. They can be plucked, but they grow back within a few days. Your eyes are twice as large as a human’s, and their color is a changing swirl of green and brown. Your finger and toe nails are wood. Your major joints (shoulder, hip, knee) creak like tree branches when you move. Roots. You have a deep and pragmatic connection with the natural world. You are proficient in the Nature and Survival skills. Darkvision. A life lived under the canopy of the forest has provided you with the ability to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, and you can speak Piney, which has no written form.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":16},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Margreve Player's Guide"},{"name":"Pixie","description":"Rarely standing taller than a lark, diminutive pixies of the Feywild embody the impressions outsiders have of fey creatures: childlike, mischievous, and brimming with magic. These fairies flit through forests and over fields, spreading their pixie dust across plants to help them bloom. But given the pixies’ exceptional ability to magically conceal themselves, their splendor can be easy to miss. When pixies want to be seen, they appear as miniature elves with butterfly wings growing from their backs. A pixie’s hair, skin, and wings take on fantastic, radiant colors and patterns depending on the environment where they were born; an arctic pixie might feature icy blue colors and furry wings, whereas an orange desert pixie could be covered in a dizzying display of red dots. Each new pixie looks radically different from the last, even when fey are directly related. Unlike their more reclusive sprite cousins, pixies are known as socialites within the Feywild. Fraternizing with other fey allows them to generate natural energy. When stagnant or dull periods of life drag on for too long, pixies find it hard to resist a small prank on an unsuspecting target to kickstart some chaos. A pixie might adventure at the request of a superior archfey, for the excitement of exploring a new world, or to tip the scales of an orderly society. While adventuring, most pixies prefer to use magic to tackle dangerous encounters instead of fighting outside their weight class. However, the might of any powerful fairy knight ready to lay down their life for a larger cause shouldn’t be discounted. Pixie Traits As a pixie, you have the following traits. Ability Score Increase . When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Age . Pixies reach maturity around 20 years old and don’t have a life expectancy. Many pixies meet their end around 300 to predators or disease. Creature Type . You are a Fey. Size . Your size is Tiny (see “Special Size Rules”). Speed . Your walking speed is 10 feet, and you have a flying speed of 30 feet. Fairy Spry .

As an action or bonus action on your turn, you can emit a cloud of dust that covers a creature you touch. Until the start of your next turn, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or damage roll of its choice. The dust then disappears. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Languages . You can speak one language of your choice.

In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar shape, but there’s little chance of mistaking a plasmoid for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most plasmoids are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores. Plasmoids don’t have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Plasmoids can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound. When plasmoids sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.

Though easily mistaken for puppets, geppettin aren’t manipulated by a just-out-of-sight puppeteer; they are animated, sentient, and independent. Living Toys As a race, the geppettin are an oddity. Though rare, they are numerous enough and share enough similarities that they may be counted as an actual race of people, and not merely freak mishaps of magic. While there might be dedicated creators of geppettin, as there are with golems, many geppettin come to life on their own. Physically, geppettin are often shorter than halflings. Their physical features vary greatly from type to type, but they are almost always humanoid in shape. For simplicity, geppettin are classified by their materials: bisque are porcelain, marionettes are wood, and plushies are made of fabric. Despite being made of somewhat flimsy materials, sentience grants them an odd hardiness. Additionally, due to their non-living nature, they never hunger, rarely tire, and are adept at being innocuous. Most find some form of work or profession in entertainment, but a few find fantastic success as spies and assassins. As living constructs, geppettin don’t age, and are mature as soon as they become sentient. Plushie Traits Plushies, also called raggedies, are any form of stuffed or soft geppettin.

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light, and darkness as if it was dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Construct Anatomy. You are immune to nonmagical diseases. You don’t need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest by spending 4 hours in a motionless state, during which you retain consciousness. False Appearance.

Led by their elders, possumfolk began leaving their homes, homes they’d been in for generations, and joining the other established towns on the coast. Possumfolk are gentle, hard-working, and loyal people; and are accepted with open arms by the other communities. Family, loyalty, and tradition are most important to the possumfolk. They have worked hard to build new lives outside of the forests, but they remain fearful. They do not like to talk about why they left except to say that they did not leave, but were driven out by a monster. Possumfolk stand like humans, but their fingers and toes curl in and they sport longer, sharper nails. Their hair grows thick and stiff, often standing straight up, and is usually a shade of gray, making it hard to distinguish how old an individual may be. Their hair can come in shades of dark or light gray and may have other colors mixed in throughout. Unlike human hair, their hair does not stop growing at the top of their neck, instead continuing to grow down their back in a furry ruff, ending at the base of their spine. Bushy eyebrows that match their hair are common and only get bushier with age, but they tend to struggle with facial hair. Possumfolk that can grow facial hair often choose not to, as their facial hair grows the same way the rest of their hair grows. Though they have human faces, some possum folk sport longer, upturned noses and larger teeth. They can have any eye color. The most unique thing about the Possumfolk is their prehensile tails. These dexterous tails help the Possumfolk with balance, so much so that they’ve become almost legendary. Despite what you might have heard, Possumfolk cannot swing around with their tail or hang upside down from limbs or rafters. These pinkish, soft, gray-haired appendages cannot lift or hold heavy things, but they are long enough to wrap around their body and are pinkish in color, covered in very light, soft gray hair. Possumfolk Traits As a possumfolk, you have the following lineage traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and one other ability of your choice increases by 1. Age. Possumfolk age and mature similarly to humans, reaching adulthood in their late teens and living to be 80-100 years old. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Size. Possumfolk, like humans, vary in height with ranges from 4 - 7 feet. Your size is medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You also have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Lethal Toxin-Neutralizing Factor. You are immune to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned. Play Dead. When you take damage, as a reaction, you can choose to Play Dead. When you do, make a Charisma (Deception) check. Each hostile creature within 60 feet of you with a lower passive Perception than what you rolled believes that you are dead and will not attempt to attack you while you are playing dead. Any hostile creature outside of this range or within range that can’t see you automatically fails this check. On your next turn, if you haven’t taken any damage, you can expend half of your movement to stand up, regaining a number of hit points equal to one hit die plus your Constitution modifier. Creatures that can detect life are not affected by this trait. Prehensile Tail. You can use your tail to help you balance and to hold items and weapons. You have advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone and can hold weapons that have the light property with your tail. You cannot attack with weapons held by your tail. At your GM’s discretion, you can use an action to improvise with your tail. While improvising with your tail, any check that you might need to make will be a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Divination Illustrations","book":"The Shrouded Coast"},{"name":"Primordial Scions","description":"The dagger glints in the air, a silent oncoming death aimed for the young prince’s spine. Before it can strike the child’s back, his nursemaid snatches it out of the air, furious grey eyes snapping up to meet the gaze of the assassin. “Miss Mawcy?” the young prince babbles—but the assassin does not look down at his target. “Oh, Hells.” Fearful eyes locked on the nursemaid, the assassin steps back as she moves forward, the prince’s toys clattering around their feet. He gags on the threat he tries to speak, hurled into the air, unseen forces dragging him from the luxurious carpet. From the dark ceiling, the whites of his terrified eyes flash. She slams him down into the plush floor. A crushing weight descends on the assassin—unable to stand, he kneels before the nursemaid and her eerily calm expression. He grates out hoarse words, panicked, to his allies on the balcony. “She’s a primordial! Run, she’s—” “Look away, Your Highness,” the nursemaid says quietly, her hand snapping out. The assassins on the balcony are wrenched toward her, falling into a pile. The last thing they see is her form consumed in light. Few creatures can trace their ancestry back to the dawn of time, but primordial scions are inextricably tied to the first angels. As some of the oldest worldwalkers, these angels give their scion mortals a glimpse of the grand inner workings of the universe—the eternal clockwork of time, kismet, and the unknowable energies that connect the planes. These scions become agents of fate, working to nudge the world in the direction it’s supposed to go. Wells of Deep Magic Primordial scions are a striking example of deceptive appearances. They resemble humanoids until they tap into a deep well of power, in which their thrumming connection to the world’s beginning manifests. As they swing weapons, wield magic, and bring their might to bear, their connections to fate, time, gravity, and life itself quake the air around them. Their eyes become one single color of blinding light, their veins glow, or their voice reverberates deeply. They might hover for a few moments as they command their gravitational ties, blur as they seem to move through time, or cause tremors in the ground with each confident step. These qualities manifest as the height of a primordial scion’s power and the intensity of their drive. Unfortunate foes who face a primordial as they awaken are dismayed to realize that they’re confronting an ancient power made manifest. Agents as Adventurers Primordial scions are the great balancers of fate and time, but their methods vary immensely. For some, balance means taking a position of leadership and making decisions for those they lead that are in line with the fates and futures they see. For others, balance means a life of careful assassinations—ridding the world of liches, archmages, monsters, tyrants, and great evils that drag the world from the course it’s meant to take. And for others still, balance is achieved through fortune-telling or positions of faith—guiding individual lives as they become lost and confused—while others choose defense and counteraction, taking positions of protection over people who are destined to be important. These are but some of the ways that primordials protect the course of the world. The realms benefit from having so many invisible tacticians at play, covering so many facets and creating an infinite web of safety against encroaching darkness. Primordials who are adventurers could find their destiny in fulfilling a prophecy with their party, protecting allies with their own fateful roles, or hunting down a cosmic evil. Cosmic Quarrels Celestial beings attuned to fate don’t forsee false events, but that doesn’t mean they can’t interpret the future in different ways. It’s possible that a primordial scion may disagree with their divine guide in an interpretation over fate’s intent, as they, too, have old magic thrumming in their veins. They may feel, think, or sense a different future meant for the world, or believe that fate has schemes at play underneath what is plainly visible. A primordial scion’s power isn’t dependent on their connection with their Celestial progenitor. They can disagree and even fight to help tip the world in the way they think things may fall, but they never lose their connection with the deep magic of their birthright. However, when a primordial pushes the world toward a future they desire rather than one decreed by fate, other scions act against that maverick. If a Celestial feels the fate of the world is threatened, they send a primordial scion to act in their name—or to descend on the iconoclast for a divine clash that bards will write about for centuries. Primordial Scions Traits Your primordial scion has the following traits. Ability Score Increase Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Age Primordial scions mature at the same rate as humans, but as some of the oldest scions to exist, they can live up to 250 years. Alignment As agents of fate, primordial scions work for the ultimate good of the world’s course—but that can lead them to believe that the ends justify the means. They tend toward good or neutral, but their decisions can manifest as chaotic, lawful, or firmly between the two. Manipulate Gravity You can manipulate one of the oldest forces in the world: gravity. As a bonus action, you can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Strength saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, you can move that creature up to 10 feet in any direction, including upward. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Divine Arbiter Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, heightening the natural effects around you as you become an avatar of world magic itself. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, as a reaction, you can cause one creature you can see within 30 feet of you to reroll its damage dice after it makes a successful attack. The creature must use the new rolls. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"MCDM Productions","book":"Arcadia Issue No. 11"},{"name":"Promethean","description":"“I can’t say I blame the Spacers for leaving. Earth had too many of its own problems to pay attention to theirs. Some say though, that the path they chose is a fine line between the best of human intentions and the worst of our ambitions.” — Jan Forrester, human pilot Once considered part of the Human race, they were a society of space explorers, miners, colonists, scientists, and settlers. Though the Earth could never be denied as their place of origin, the blue planet is no longer considered their “home.” Adopting the name of a figure of legend, they have forged themselves into a new race of beings. They are evolved. They are awakened. They are Prometheans. Same Make, New Model Before the Sol System became part of the Sorium Accord, many of the humans that lived and worked in the space colonies performed genetic enhancements upon themselves and their people. Though commonplace, many of the alterations were minor, specifically purposed to assist in survival against the harshness of the void. It was not long before many of the space colonists viewed their Earth neighbors as pampered and weak, while those upon the Earth viewed the colonists as conceited and ignorant. For all the efforts of human societies to shed their societal prejudices, they simply managed to evolve them to expand beyond the confines of their world. The colonists did less and less to help with Earth’s problems and vice versa, to the point where it was almost as if there were two different human races. The Final Schism The colonists and surface-folk had developed a truce during the legendary X-Mark conflict that erupted between Earth’s nations when the Crucible was first discovered. Their space miners harvested much of the sorium, their scientists soon discovering how to further genetically modify their own traits. These newly discovered methods gave their people newfound hereditary traits, as well as some hindrances. Still, the space colonies had never forgotten the generations spent on the sidelines of Earth’s governments. When the Sorium Accord was signed, they chose to separate from the rest of their people, officially naming themselves prometheans and establishing a society based on organizational roles on the planet Ondus. Perfecting the Gods’ Design With their own evolution and survival at stake, this new society focused on adapting themselves to their new environment and homeworld. Throughout the last century, the newly formed prometheans have strived to control their own stages of growth as a species. At an early age, each are subjected to genetic modifications. Once a promethean reaches their young adult years, they go through a final process that has come to be called the “Chrysalis,” named after the machine used for the procedure. This process determines what type of promethean they will become. This focus on particular enhancements, however, limits their evolution to science. With this in mind, much of the versatility that is prominent in other humans is greatly diminished. Physically, a promethean’s outer appearance is not much different from a human. Their builds are similar and they still retain the same broad variety of skintone, complexion, and eye color. The biggest difference is that such things can now be programmed instead of left to chance. Aside from silvery roots, hair color still varies for prometheans of the crescent, while the fire-blooded are limited to deep browns and reds. Promethean Names Abandoning most of their human identity, the prometheans also established their own families and genetic lineages. Some of the family names are simple variants of those carried by their human ancestors, while others have completely changed. In recent years, the given names for promethean children have also varied greatly, no longer influenced by Earth history or culture. Male Names: Bareino, Cyphus, Daviel, Fiano, Idran, Jalan, Katar, Kyrian, Ledra, Malor, Palarm, Raegar, Salenkis, Thartan, Vesio Female Names: Aimeri, Auriane, Covalla, Delinia, Jessia, Kymber, Melisi, Nova, Ovara, Retalia, Seina, Ulaire, Verela, Wynna, Yanlee Clan Names: Artemia, Corvinus, Falwren, Hexstar, Kaperia, Praxus, Sartori, Thurnos, Ultro, Zhavel Promethean Traits Prometheans share a few common traits before undergoing the Chrysalis. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Prometheans have yet to discover the balance between extending their years and adapting their bodies to the rigors of their new home. Thus, they still reach adulthood in their late teens and live to about 100 years. Alignment. A young society, prometheans often take caution to the wind, often leaning toward a chaotic alignment. This, however is a mere tendency as there are still prometheans of all personality types. Size. Like their human kin, height and weight varies but retain a size of Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Most prometheans gain this trait at a young age, sometimes even passed along through their parents. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were in dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Languages. You speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Sub-species. Prometheans become one of two types after they pass the Chrysalis into adulthood. Subraces Crescent Fire-Blooded The Aberrant: Perfect Imperfections In extremely rare circumstances, the process of the Chrysalis produces a different form of promethean. Called aberrants, they emerge with horrible deformities and are often driven mad. Most, however, are also gifted with dangerous abilities. If not euthanized, they are often treated as societal outcasts, forced into the dregs of promethean society.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":27051},"publisher":"Alligator Alley Entertainment","book":"Esper Genesis Core Manual"},{"name":"Qualyth","description":"Qualyths are lizard-like humanoids with a lithe and agile build imbued with an uncanny ability to quickly recover from injuries and adapt to any environment.

Like the shadow fey, quicksteps are innately resilient to the corruption that infuses the area, and they embrace life in the courts with aplomb. Most quicksteps have a fondness for finery and feel right at home amid the riches of court life. As their name implies, quicksteps possess a natural affinity for speed, which makes them exquisitely qualified for two favored shadow fey pastimes: sabotage and dueling. Quicksteps are rarely found outside the fey courts but have thriving communities within many of the courts, most notably in the Court of Midnight Teeth and the Court of Winter's Love. Yet quicksteps are not immune to the wanderlust most fey experience.

Supported by supernatural creatures, humans, elves and other species conquered the world. Many pacts were made in these times, and some of those were of a pretty... physical nature. Humans in particular spawned offspring with devils, demons and other creatures. The famous tales of a few tieflings that betrayed their ancestors and brought death and suffering over the lands coined the perspective on this race since millennia. They are seen as inherently untrustworthy, even though it were their ancestors who used them as bargaining chips. The best chance for a tiefling to get into a respectable position was to offer their services as mercenaries. As long as they were useful, people treated them - relatively - well. The War of Vallenis even saw several tiefling heroes - who were later framed for their evil deeds when it turned out the whole bloodshed was a bad idea. Many of the entities that spawned half-human offspring kept an eye on them, trying to keep them \"pure\" (for whatever purpose they had in mind for them). Their rivals often tried diluting the bloodlines, actively trying to create mixed offspring with tieflings. This strategy led to a new subrace - tieflings that were infused with the essence of a variety of fiendish (and sometimes also other) creatures. The mixed heritage of these so-called Ragtag Tieflings not only changed their appearance, but also had an influence on their racial traits. Ragtag Tieflings Ragtag Tieflings have not just one fiendish heritage - their blood has been infused with the essence of dozens or even hundreds of supernatural creatures over the millennia. This mixed heritage shows in their entire appearance. Their skin has patches of different colours, they might have two different horns or eye colours, and so on. Some ragtag tieflings show such a variety in physical features that it's hard to decide where to look first. A Ragtag Tiefling with her Flowercat companion Due to their diluted bloodlines, the planar entities that originally spawned their ancestors often lost interest in them - either not caring about them at all anymore, or trying to break them, so they would become predictable again. Many ragtags fled, choosing a life of running away just to survive. In some cases, the supernatural beings were on Virthys when the world ended, and some of them actually died for good. To the ragtag tieflings trying to dodge these entities, the apocalypse meant freedom. In the new world of Ashandri, a surprisingly high number of ragtags found their way to the Ocean Heart. Whether they ran away from the invading Ravager Elves, or they just sought the freedom of living in a swimming city or even as pirates, the great deep sea seems to call for many of them. Traits Ragtag Tieflings receive these racial traits: Ability Score Increase: Intelligence+2, Dexterity+1 Age : Ragtag Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer. Alignment : Ragtag Tieflings have no innate tendencies toward any alignment. Many of them have an independent nature, and tend toward a chaotic alignment. Size : Most Ragtag Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. Speed : Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision: Thanks to your Infernal heritage, you have superior Vision in dark and dim Conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in Darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in Darkness, only Shades of Gray. Switching Resistance: Theoretically, you have an innate resistance against many different damage types. But only two of these resistances are dominant - and therefore active - at any given time. After finishing a long rest, you roll twice on the following table to determine which resistances become active. Alternatively, you (or your gamemaster) can roll when having a resistance becomes relevant for the first time after a long rest. If you want to, your character can have a certain \"tell\" for what type of resistances are active.

You think I STOLE this? No no no... it was on discount. The five finger discount. Look! A distraction!” - Harried Houdinky, Voleur Extraordinaire Yells and chuckles are common sounds around the home of any rakin (RACK-in) thanks to their shared love language: pranks. From sewer-side burrows to palatial penthouses, wattle-and-daub huts to intricate treetop villages, rakin can be found at all levels of society, a product of their ingeniousness and habit of getting into trouble. One is rarely bored around a rakin. Deific Origins The mistaken spawn of a passionate tryst between deities of trickery and nature, rakin hold a deep affinity for both domains. Since their creation, they have had little contact with either god30, learning to rely on their own wits to survive. Trickery. As rakin society progressed, their culture grew to value trickery and subterfuge. Good-natured pranks sprang from their paws as instinctively as breathing. Honed against the fearsome beasts of the forest, this innate talent to deceive helped the rakin bloom as a civilisation. Tales are still told of how Mack Gyver fought off a rampaging owlboar with nought but a goodberry , a silver needle, and a pig’s bladder. Pranks. Rakin politics, religion, and interpersonal relationships revolve around the idea of practical jokes. An atmosphere of one-up-manship and lighthearted merriment suffuses all of their wheelings and dealings. Even when faced with the most horrid of circumstances, a rakin’s first instinct is to crack a joke. Ideological Chasm After centuries of living in chaotic mirth, an ideological battle split rakin culture in two when they first made contact with other humanoids. Many of the rakin were intrigued by cities—forests of stone and steel; organized, yet unpredictable, and full of opportunity. The elders forbade them to interact, alleging such civilization to be directly counter to the chaos that nature intended, the principle upon which rakin culture was built. The debacle spiralled into a full-on feud between the opposing rakin factions, sundering the once united race. The urkin broke with tradition and followed their ambition into the cities, whilst the tanukin remained in their indigenous forests, adhering to their ancestral ways.

Resembling small hawks, eagles, and other birds of prey, they have sharp talons and agile builds that help them effortlessly glide through the canopy. These birdfolk are swift and strong with an uncanny knack for tracking. They are rarely prey, and are quick to turn the tables when finding themselves hunted. Perceptive Awareness Given their heightened senses, often raptors appear to be distracted or deep in thought. In reality, they are processing the wealth of sensory information they receive from their particularly keen eyes and sensitive ears. While many folk are only ever aware of what goes on directly around them, raptors have an extremely wide field of awareness. Raptors are adept at living off the land. They are skilled hunters, usually leading the harvesting of meat and skins for their perches. Raptors are especially well versed in stalking prey from great heights, lining up impossible shots that their prey could not predict. Natural Predator While many of the birdfolk races are culturally communal, raptors don’t have a great sense of connectedness, nor do they tend to create their own perches. They are more likely to adopt a transient lifestyle, moving from perch to perch, or to simply live in the vast forests of the Wood itself. Though typically quiet, raptors are not averse to forming relationships with other birdfolk. Despite their reserved nature, raptors value personal bonds more highly than societal or even familial ties. Raptor Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age.

Preferring the path of naturalists and hunters, raptors rarely see value in order for the sake of order, and are often more pragmatic than idealistic. Size. Raptors are lean, muscular hunters, but they stand less than 4 feet tall. Their light builds usually lend themselves to bodies that weigh far less than one would expect for their height, averaging around only 35 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Glide. Using your feathered arms, you can slow your fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose, although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you are encumbered. Talons. Your sharp claws aid you in unarmed combat and while climbing. Your damage for an unarmed strike is 1d4 piercing damage. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb any surface your talons could reasonably grip. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Woodland Hunter. Your accuracy allows you to treat three-quarters cover as half cover and half cover as no cover. Hunter’s Training. You have proficiency with the longbow, short bow, and spear.

They are about the same size as halflings but of a slimmer build. They often wear hooded cloaks or long robes to conceal their true nature from the gaze of casual onlookers. Ratfolk can be found throughout Midgard, from Zobeck and other cities of the Crossroads region to the dusty streets of Per-Bastet in distant Nuria Natal and the valley of Golden Ulthar. The little creatures often inhabit the fringes of human society, scraping a living as petty thieves and tricksters. Many make their homes in decrepit slum tenements, in disused dockside warehouses, or even in sewers and other warrens beneath the city streets. Some, particularly in the Southlands, live a nomadic existence, wandering from place to place and trading in whatever odds and ends they acquire along the way, through honest means or otherwise. Other groups can be found on small tropical islands in the Tethys Ocean. Family is important to ratfolk, and their strong communal ties mean they often form or join tight-knit criminal societies. Although some ratfolk have been known to ally themselves with goblins, kobolds, or the darakhul, they prefer to serve a mysterious “rat king” who is usually, but not always, a powerful rodent or ratlike creature of some sort. Many of Zobeck’s ratfolk are loyal servants of the Free City’s infamous Mouse King—picking pockets, burgling mansions, and smuggling goods up and down the Argent River on behalf of their monarch. Others serve any powerful figure as scouts, saboteurs, and infiltrators on their master’s behalf. Whoever their master may be, ratfolk are loyal to their kin. Ratfolk enjoy collecting interesting trinkets and baubles, and hoard these items in their homes, often in preference to more valuable (but dull) gold and silver coins. Ratfolk Names Among themselves, ratfolk use names that identify their family and their place within the family, in the same mold as human names like Ivan Ivorson. They seldom use these names among non-ratfolk, however. Instead, they seem to derive perverse pleasure and great humor from giving themselves nicknames that make humans and elves uncomfortable, such as Plaguesores and Stinqface. Ratfolk are infamously hard to offend, so the more offensive the nickname, the more it amuses them. These nicknames are no different between males and females. Ratfolk Nicknames.

Those stinkin’ ratters are hungry, and right vicious! They nearly took me gods-accursed arm! And I only have the one left! ...On secon’ thought, go right ahead, maybe then you’ll stop terrorizin’ me lawn...” —Old Man Jenkins, the accidental discoverer and namer of the ratters, to a neighborhood ruffian, just outside the entrance to the sewers of Waterdeep Ratters are a miniscule, rodent-like people that live in groups called infestations, often inhabiting the sewers beneath heavily populated cities. Their metabolisms are just as quick as their minds, creating a ravenous hunger in most ratters for both food and knowledge. This curiosity and peckishness combined with their flexible bodies means that if there’s a place a ratter shouldn’t be, they probably found a way to get in. Sewer Critters Ratters have large, rounded ears, beady eyes that range from light brown to deep black, and pointed snouts ending in inquisitive pink noses and elongated foreteeth. Their fur comes in a variety of understated colors such as grey, black, brown, white, or any combination thereof. This fur is long and fluffy when clean, but will often appear matted, unkempt, or even spiky due to a lack of grooming habits and a tendency to live in filth. The bushiness of their fur belies the lithe bodies underneath. Ratters are deceptively slim and highly flexible, with loose joints that allow them to squeeze into seemingly impossible gaps. They also have broad, pointed claws on the tips of their fingers and toes, which are ideal for climbing or burrowing in soft earth. Lightweight, flexible, and capable of slipping or scraping through tight spaces, ratters have little trouble infiltrating food stores and getting into other places they aren’t wanted. Live Fast, Die Young As intelligent creatures, ratters are acutely aware of just how short their twenty-year lifespans are as compared to those of other humanoids. Ratters despise wasting time. They speak quickly, think quickly, and take action quickly, without dwelling on the consequences or any other “wasteful” thoughts. They take offense, often violently, to any action or custom they deem to be a waste of their time, such as smalltalk, waiting in lines, or dealing with bureaucracy; ratters will usually put their quick minds to work finding a creative way around such pointless obstructions. Most organized societies consider ratters to be loathsome pests and will go to great lengths to keep an infestation out of their sewers. For their part, ratters harbor a much more powerful dislike, and sometimes even hatred, of these longer-lived races; they’re viciously jealous of creatures with greater lifespans, especially elves. Compared to other races that seem to have all the time in the world, ratters find it incredibly unfair to have been given so little time. A ratter’s short life also sparks within them a fundamental desire to continue to have an impact after they’re gone, to leave a legacy behind. While many ratters believe their legacies are completed simply by surviving to continue their lines, others are dissatisfied at the idea of using their limited time only for the purpose or procreation. These ratters yearn to accomplish greater feats, and some, seeking something new they can contribute to their infestations, turn their minds to gaining and utilizing knowledge. Painfully aware of how limited their time is, these scholarly ratters blaze through texts and tomes, desperate to discover some lost lore such as the secret to attaining immortality, or to find an adventure that will be sung of in taverns across the world — anything that will keep their memory alive throughout the eons. Family Matters Ratters understand just how little time they have with their family members, so they cherish these bonds deeply while they can. Mother ratters tend to give birth to several litters per year, each litter containing six to ten pups, causing ratter infestations to expand rapidly. Quick to form attachments, ratters tend to consider the rats, mice, and other rodents of the sewers to be family, too, often treating them as siblings or beloved pets. Whether this behavior is due to similarity of appearance or of circumstance is unknown, but the attachments formed are fierce, and ratters even develop ways to communicate with their smaller, subterranean fellows. Unfortunately, the ratters’ high birth rates, huge families, and fast metabolisms can quickly combine to cause food shortages within an infestation, eventually forcing the family to the point of desperation. Ratters’ terrible hunger, when left unsatisfied for extended periods, begins to drive them mad, until they must either leave the infestation on a blind and perilous search for food, or begin feeding upon each other. Most ratters that survive to reach adulthood bear numerous scars, afflictions, and diseases due to the feeding frenzies they’ve battled through down in the sewers. Even this violent cycle of starvation and madness cannot break a loyal ratter’s family bonds, however. After a frenzy has abated, the remaining members of the infestation quickly make amends, their devotion running deep enough to survive the carnage. Ratter Adventurers Most often, a ratter becomes an adventurer after their hunger drives them from their infestation, and once their faculties return, they find themself completely lost in a place they don’t recognize. Occasionally, a ratter infestation will be discovered and routed by the authorities of the city that lies atop the infestation’s sewer dens, causing much of the family to become separated or slain. And once in a great while, a ratter may be so grievously wounded during a feeding frenzy that their familial bonds snap, causing them to leave the infestation of their own accord. Ratters hunger for a social group nearly as much as they do for food, and they find it hard to resist the urge to find a replacement for the family they lost. Most often, this is achieved by stumbling onto an adventuring group. Thanks to their capacity for deep familial bonds and their extreme impatience, ratters tend to make themselves into fiercely loyal, if often troublesome, members of these parties. Though their instincts and physical attributes naturally lead many ratters to become rogues, the more scholarly ratters who pursue knowledge tend to follow the path of wizardry. However, it isn’t uncommon to find ratter fighters traveling with adventuring groups, their bellicose inclinations and violent experiences having inspired them to master weaponry. Ratter Names Ratters are often named in the Ratter language, which is comprised of clicks, chitters, squeaks, and emphatic full-body movements that indicate tone. Since most creatures find it difficult to recreate the language precisely, and ratters are generally too impatient to teach them, a ratter is often forced to adopt a name that can be more easily pronounced by their companions. Most ratters, snickering to themselves over their own creativity, will use an onomatopoeia or verb from the Common language, but with a letter missing. Ratters place no stock in surnames, but when forced to present one, they will often make it an homage to — or parody of — the city of their birth. Ratter Names: Bit, Burro, Clim, Cratch, Creech, Hitter, Ibble, Iss, Munc, Queak, Runch, Stel, Swip, Tab Ratter Surnames: Alwayssummer, Baldursdoor, Brassburgh, Darkmade, Deepwater, Helmholder, Homeunder, Lentilkeep, Neverday, Shallowpuddle, Thampvolo, Zarunyan Ratter Traits Your ratter character has the following common traits all ratters share. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity, Constitution, and Intelligence scores each increase by 1. Age. Ratters reach adulthood after only 2 to 3 years, and don’t generally live much longer than 20 years, their extreme metabolic rate aging them much more quickly than most other humanoids. Alignment. Due to their impatient personalities and the fact that their monstrously fast metabolisms make them almost constantly hungry, ratters have little to no regard for societal conventions, niceties, or anything else they deem to be a waste of their short time to live. They usually take what they want without asking, especially when what they want is food, and they often resort to violence if something or someone is preventing them from grabbing it. Most ratters tend to be chaotic, if not also evil. Size. Ratters range from 2 to 3 feet tall, and weigh an average of about 30 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed. You have a base walking speed of 25 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Bite. Your sharp, pronounced foreteeth are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Impatient Mind. When you resolve the Research downtime activity, described in Chapter 2 of Xanathar’s Guide to Everything , you roll the Intelligence check for the Research Outcomes table twice, gaining the results of both rolls. Loquela Rattus. You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with rats and similar rodents. Such creatures can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them. Rodent Nimbleness. You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Additionally, you are considered one size smaller for the purpose of squeezing into narrow holes and passages. Vermin Infiltration. Due to your light weight, quick mind, and specialized claws, you can get inside almost any place you choose. You have a climbing speed of 25 feet, and a burrowing speed of 5 feet. You can only use this burrowing speed to tunnel through soft dirt or mud, and the tunnel quickly collapses after you pass through. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Ratter.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Sterling Vermin Adventuring Co.","book":"The Ultimate Adventurer's Handbook"},{"name":"Ravenfolk","description":"Few races in Midgard live amid so much rumor, suspicion, and outright falsehood as the ravenfolk. They make their rookeries in every major city. Depending on whom you ask, they might condemn the ravenfolk as solitary wanderers bearing misfortune or praise them as messengers from the gods. Ravenfolk are loyal comrades and treacherous thieves, brave warriors and contemptible cowards. They are despised for their strange and secretive culture, and criticized for having no true culture of their own. The ravenfolk are a study in contradictions. These truths, half-truths, and lies conceal a greater mystery that few outsiders know. If the ravenfolk have a homeland, it is in Beldestan to the east; or a branch of Wotan’s tree to the North; or on a high cliff of Horus’ hidden temple in the South. They have settlements in Trollheim, Vidim, Domovogrod, Nuria Natal, and the Dragon Empire. None of these are large, but in Nuria Natal at least, they serve honorably as temple guards and as defenders of the faithful of Horus. Ravenfolk have no wings, but they do have tail feathers that sometimes flare out when they’re angry. Of Gods and Men The ravenfolk of Midgard (also known as the huginn) are wily scoundrels, tricksters, assassins, spies, and thieves. The oldest tales say that the god Wotan the Rune Father brought the clever ravenfolk into being when he plucked the feathers from his two pet ravens, Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory), and let the feathers drift down to Midgard. The feathers became ravenfolk, and they spread across the world as Wotan’s spies. In truth, the ravenfolk are a bridge between everyday life on Midgard and the realm of the gods. They share Wotan’s secret knowledge of the branches of Yggdrasil the world tree. In the far northern reaches, the huginn are both the embodiment of the gods’ will and a symbol of inevitable death in battle. Thieves, One and All No matter what trade, role, or profession a ravenfolk takes up, they are all thieves. They build their rookeries from found items, and much like normal ravens, have a great fondness for shiny baubles. Beyond physical thievery, they live to steal secrets. Ravenfolk are naturally adept at being unobtrusive, and they use that trait to feed their insatiable curiosity. The Tsar of Vidim employs a great flock of huginn as his personal spies and assassins. Aside from their larcenous instincts, ravenfolk are scrupulous about keeping their word. That’s not to say they don’t lie; ravenfolk lie as much as anyone else, and maybe a bit more when the pressure’s on. But if a promise or a vow can be extracted from one, it’s as reliable as gold—which may be why ravenfolk seldom make promises or vows. Otherwise, their personalities are as varied as those of other races. They adapt readily to whatever environment they occupy, from remote wilderness to big cities—although their presence in cities is not always welcome. They frequently take on local customs, traditions, and beliefs to fit in with the community. Ravenfolk Names As with many other races whose native language is difficult for more humanlike vocal organs to deal with, ravenfolk tend to use different names among humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoids than they use among their own kind. When choosing human-friendly names, ravenfolk borrow liberally from local traditions, mythology, and popular songs and poetry. They prefer names that invoke imagery (Starshadow, Moonglow, Rainshimmer) over more prosaic labels, but that’s as much consistency as it’s possible to define. Furthermore, since these aren’t their real names, ravenfolk have little attachment to them. They swap names whenever they feel like it, until they finally settle on one that really suits them. Ravenfolk Traits Your ravenfolk character has certain characteristics in common with all other ravenfolk. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1. Age. Ravenfolk reach adulthood at 10 years old, and can live to be 110. Alignment. Ravenfolk tend toward chaos thanks to their capriciousness and insatiable curiosity. Greed overwhelms some ravenfolk, drawing them toward evil. Size. Ravenfolk are slighter and shorter than humans. They range from 4 feet to just shy of 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Sudden Attack. You have advantage on attack rolls against a surprised creature. Mimicry. Ravenfolk can mimic any sound they’ve heard. Make a Charisma (Deception) check against the passive Wisdom (Insight) of any listeners. Success indicates they believe the sound you created was real. Trickster. You have proficiency in the Deception and Stealth skills. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Huginn’s Speech and Northern Tongue.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Ravenite Dragonborn","description":"Wildemount was the cradle from which all dragonborn civilization grew. The city-state of Draconia rose in the Dreemoth Ravine along the southern edge of the continent, when foreign dragonkin fleeing the gods’ wrath during the Calamity forged an alliance with native dragonborn already dwelling there. The colonizing dragonborn, who called themselves draconbloods, worked with the native dragonborn, called ravenites, to build a society that could withstand the wandering monsters of Xhorhas. However, Draconia swiftly descended into corruption and bigotry, and the draconblood ruling class betrayed and enslaved their ravenite kin. Twenty years ago, Draconia was destroyed by the ire of the mighty Chroma Conclave, and the city-state’s ruins were occupied by an ancient white dragon named Vorugal. The chaos of the attack upended draconblood civilization, and the ravenite slaves rose up and drove their former masters from the Dreemoth Ravine. Now masters of their own fate, the ravenite dragonborn have rebuilt their home within the ravine and have begun to spread out across the world. Dragonborn Variants You can allow a player to choose one of the following dragonborn variants. Dragonborn Variant: Ravenite Ravenites have no tails and a hearty physique. They remember the days when they were slaves to the draconblood, as well as the day when they overthrew their masters. A ravenite uses the dragonborn traits in the Player’s Handbook , with the following traits replacing the Ability Score Increase and Damage Resistance traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Vengeful Assault. When you take damage from a creature in range of a weapon you are wielding, you can use your reaction to make an attack with the weapon against that creature. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Dragonborn in the Dwendalian Empire The Dwendalian Empire has seen a massive influx of dragonborn since the fall of Draconia. Most of the draconblood nobles who fled into the empire tried to use their grandiloquent names and titles to earn favors and prestige. But without the power of a nation-state behind them, many of those former slave owners were forced into lives of farming or hard labor. Some in the empire speak in awed whispers of the “former dragonborn princes” who now live as paupers, while others scoff at these haughty dragonborn’s delusions of grandeur. Many ravenites have journeyed to the Dwendalian Empire in the years since the death of Vorugal, but the first of those found a colder reception than was given their former masters. The empire had no desire to grant asylum to revolutionaries, and would have turned the ravenites away had the Cerberus Assembly not intervened. For reasons unknown, the Assembly created the shantytown of Talonstadt for displaced ravenites, allowing them to trade labor for lodging there. Dragonborn on the Menagerie Coast Many of the draconbloods fleeing their ruined city-state settled among the people of the Clovis Concord. Some had beach homes and private villas to flee to, and were able to establish businesses with the money they had stashed away there. Others were not so fortunate, and were forced to take menial jobs to make ends meet. Many residents of the Clovis Concord feel a twinge of sympathy for the draconblood exiles, but most commoners who have any knowledge of the ravenite uprising see this life of servitude as just punishment. Many of the ravenites who travel to the warm sands of the coast are merchants or wealthy generals or politicians on vacation. As such, all ravenites on the Menagerie Coast are assumed to have wealth—even exiles or penniless adventurers. Any tailless dragonborn who wanders through the cities of the Clovis Concord must constantly fend off hucksters, peddlers, and thieves. Dragonborn in Xhorhas Countless draconbloods fled into the wastes of Xhorhas in search of asylum, and some even dared approach the intimidating walls of Rosohna. The dark elves of the Kryn Dynasty were eager to welcome these formerly isolated people into their ranks—though their reasons for doing so were less than altruistic. More dragonborn living within range of the Luxon’s beacons deepens the well of experiences that drow engaged in anamnesis can draw from, bringing their people closer to true enlightenment. The dark elves have no interest in the rift between the draconbloods and the ravenites, and treat both peoples as equals.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Explorer's Guide to Wildemount (deprecated)"},{"name":"Ravenite Dragonborn","description":"Ravenites have no tails and a hearty physique.

Death isn’t always the end. The reborn exemplify this, being individuals who have died yet, somehow, still live. Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal ends, their ashen flesh or bloodless veins making it clear that they’ve been touched by death. Other reborn are marvels of magic or science, being stitched together from disparate beings or bearing mysterious minds in manufactured bodies. Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own. Faded Memories Reborn suffer from some manner of discontinuity, an interruption of their lives or physical state that their minds are ill equipped to deal with. Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent. Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back. Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details. Lost Memories d6 Memory 1 You recall a physically painful moment.

Gosh, you’re so big, you must have been eatin’ a lotta squishers, huh? What cave do you come from?” Orem and Falk looked at one another. “Can…you hear that?” “I…is it that lizard?” “Hey why are you noisin’ with your glom holes? Do you not just talk in your bonker? That’s so weird. Hey what’s that scrizzly stuff comin’ out your face, can I have some? Hey wait come back, where you going don’t you wanna stay for some splishers?” Plont and Glung watched as the two figures beat a hasty retreat. “…I don’t think they wanna stay for splishers, Glung.” “Yeah, I guess not. Maybe I wasn’t friendly enough, I’ll try harder next time.” “Yeah maybe.” “Hey Plont, how wide can you open your glom hole I can get mine pretty wide see blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa…” “Oh yeah, that is pretty wide, good job.” Produced over centuries as ordinary cave salamanders slowly absorbed the cosmic energies emitted by Vaz’kin’rai, salari are innocent, selfless, and curious creatures that enjoy the simple pleasures in life – glomming on a splisher or squisher, checking their Rock, or having a keekon with their friends and loved ones. Physiology Standing approximately two to three feet tall at adulthood, salari tend to have pale, semi-translucent skin and white eyes as a result of the dark cave environment they normally call home. Most salari have some form of head adornment, either a set of gill stalks like those of an axolotl, or other frills and fins. Most salari weigh about as much as a small human child, averaging 30 to 40 pounds, and are bipedal, pattering around on stumpy legs. Webbed feet and hands help them swim through water – all the better for catching splishers. Astral Influence Though they do not know it, salari owe their existence to ‘The Big Smooth’, a mysterious metal doorway that appeared suddenly centuries ago, leaking cosmic energy into the surroundings that steadily accelerated the salari’s mental capacity until they developed intelligence and even limited telepathy. The Big Smooth’s influence has led to a curious civilization where the carefree salari have a personality much like children, concerned with little other than enjoying themselves and playing with their friends. Their telepathic abilities meanwhile ensure that secrets and lies are absent entirely from salari culture, it being extremely difficult if not utterly impossible to hide the truth from each other when they spend so much time in contact with each other’s thoughts. As a result, salari give freely and wholly of their trust to all, something that an outsider could easily take advantage of. Closed Caves Developing in a sealed ecosystem has led salari to become curious, friendly, and utterly oblivious to danger. Life without predators means that the idea of enemies or those that would do them harm is utterly alien to the salari, and those few that have been sighted elsewhere have trouble looking after themselves in a world much more dangerous than the one they are accustomed to. Thankfully, this is rarely a problem for salari as they tend to remain within their cave, oblivious to what lies beyond. Every now and then, however, a salari is overcome with curiosity and makes the difficult climb to the one exit from their home – a small crack in the ceiling above Splisher Lake… Distant Cousins Although the salari originate in the cave system near Vaz’kin’rai, there have been reports of similar creatures in other places within Tyllia. It is unknown whether these originate from salari escaping from Splisher Lake, are a mere coincidence, or Vaz’kin’rai is but one of multiple places where the Starscape’s influence bleeds into the Mortal Fold… I believe further investigation is required here. I find it a remarkable coincidence that two separate groups would evolve simultaneously, but equally feel that given the curious nature of these salari, it would be deeply surprising if they had ignored the nearby settlement when leaving. Perhaps when your research is finished, you can investigate the Blackford Cavern site.

Most satyrs are driven by simple desires, to see the world and to sample its every pleasure. While their spontaneity and whimsy sometimes put them at odds with more stoic peoples, satyrs rarely let the moodiness of others hinder their own happiness. Life is a blessing from the gods, after all, and the proper response to such a gift, as far as most satyrs are concerned, is to accept it with relish. Born of the Wild In their physical forms, satyrs embody a fusion of humanoid civilization with the freedom of wild beasts. Generally, they look similar to humans, with a range of builds and features. But their goatlike horns, pointed ears, and furred lower bodies sharply distinguish them. Satyrs' solid horns connect to their heads at the base of their skulls, while their legs end in sturdy hooves. Thick fur covers their bodies from the waist down, shorter at the waist and longer below the knees. Short, soft hair grows down their neck and spine, along their shoulders, and on their forearms. Embracing Life Most satyrs believe that the other peoples of Theros are woefully burdened with the plague of seriousness. Satyrs scoff at the efforts of polis-builders with their laws and right angles, and they poke fun at philosophers with their endless theories and interminable discourse. Satyrs feel that life is to be lived and experienced with all the senses. Satyrs see the world and everything in it as a book of delights, and they want to explore every page. See chapter 3 for more details on the satyr homeland, the Skola Vale. The Art of the Revel The humans of the poleis generally think of satyrs' revels as raucous bacchanals, where anything and everything might happen. This picture isn't wrong, but it's incomplete: there's more to a revel than debauchery. For satyrs, revelry is a way of life. It's the delight in small things: the song of a bird, a warm breeze, the smell of a tasty pie, relaxing by a river in the sunshine. Life freely offers these gifts, and for a satyr, they are more valuable than gold or glory. To revel means to forget the constraints of time, to let go of the future and past, and to be wholly in the present moment. For satyrs, encountering life with all the senses honors the gods, and—most importantly—it feels really good. Driven by instinct and intuition, most satyrs prove unpredictable, following their sense of wonder wherever it leads. Very Odd Indeed Satyrs are known for their eccentricities. Some people spend too much time worrying over why satyrs behave as they do. But satyrs themselves simply are as they are, feeling no need to understand what drives them, much less explain it to others. The Satyr Eccentricities table suggests a few tastes or proclivities your satyr character might possess. Satyr Eccentricities d8 Characteristic 1 Flowers are the most amazing things ever. I want to pick them, wear them, and discover their silent secrets. 2 There isn’t a tree or statue that isn’t fun to climb. 3 Nothing wards off bad luck like a jolly dance. 4 Sometimes talking to a plant really helps. 5 If stumped, I smoke a pipe. And if I’m going to smoke a pipe, it’s going to be a splendid pipe. 6 I imagine that my clothes are my glorious soul on display for all the world to behold, and I dress accordingly. 7 Having horns is the best. They are fun to decorate, and they can pop open an amphora, no problem. 8 If I have something really important to say, I always make sure to sing it. Satyr Names A satyr's name is as playful and mischievous as they are, and each one is given when a satyr's personality shines through. Most satyrs also give each other nicknames.

Satyrs range from just under 5 feet to about 6 feet in height, with generally slender builds. Your size is Medium. Here's how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier: Size modifier = 2d8 Height = 4 feet + 8 inches + your size modifier in inches Weight in pounds = 100 + (2d4 × your size modifier) Speed.

Mirthful Leaps. Whenever you make a long or high jump, you can roll a d8 and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. This extra distance costs movement as normal. Reveler. You have proficiency in the Performance and Persuasion skills, and you have proficiency with one musical instrument of your choice. Languages.

They prefer forested wilderness but are not afraid to enter towns and cities to enjoy the company and other benefits of civilization. Goat Men Satyrs have the lower body of a goat and the upper body of an elf. A pair of goat-like horns sprout from their foreheads. These horns can range from small spikes to huge horns worthy of a mountain goat. In addition to a full head of hair, satyrs grow fur on their arms, legs, and torsos. Some satyrs grow less fur, and many choose to carefully shave the hair from their arms and body. They can have brown, black, blonde, red, grey, or white hair. Their skin color ranges from dark to pale. Hedonistic Satyrs are in tune with their emotions to a degree that can be disturbing to other races. They want to experience everything: happiness, sadness, love, rage, etc. The only thing they avoid is boredom. They love music, wine, and dancing. They also enjoy an interest in carnal pleasures, and they are not afraid to share a bed with any of the other intelligent races. Music Lovers Satyrs love to listen to music. They will happily spend long stretches of time both playing and composing new music. They are known to travel great distances to hear new songs, instruments, and poetry. Satyrs in Thylea Satyrs don’t have the same strained relationship with the civilized races of Thylea that the centaurs do. Satyrs can be found in many towns and villages throughout Thylea, as well as the great city of Mytros. They are attracted to the abundance of experiences that civilization provides: the food, the wine, and most especially the music. The civilized races of Thylea are suspicious of satyrs, for there are many stories of satyrs seducing and corrupting both the old and the young alike.

And do we not now know that there are hundreds of them found fossil up and down the world? People call them Pterodactyles: but that is only because they are ashamed to call them flying dragons, after denying so long that flying dragons could exist.” —Charles Kingsley, The Water Babies Like their behemoth kin, the saurians are relics of an ancient time and unknown to nearly all inhabitants of the worlds of D&D. As a people, saurians struggle to uphold time honored traditions while they maintain the ruins of their once opulent city states. Individually, each saurian must decide for themselves if they will maintain their culture in its long decline or leave their ancestral home to find a new life. Kin to Behemoths Saurians tower over other humanoid races. The size of the saurian race is proof, saurians say, of their mandate of rulership over the younger races and their connection to the primordial origins of the world. When their foot falls shake the earth and echo off the hills, even the skeptical are inclined to give their point consideration. Their appearance is further evidence of their ancient and titanic origins. All saurians resemble the behemoths commonly believed by scholars to have ruled the world in prehistoric times. Different saurian subraces resemble different species of behemoths but all are covered with a scaled or feathered hide, possess large black eyes, and have a tail. The End of an Era The reign of the saurians was long but so far in the distant past that none but their own scholars even recall the details of it. In the modern age, saurians remain in ancient, gilded cities deep in the forgotten places of the world. Hidden away in these lands lost to time, saurians remain committed to the culture and traditions of their ancestors. Even as their numbers grow fewer with each passing decade, saurians still look to the past rather than embrace the future. In that bygone age, the saurian people ruled sprawling empires from capitols littered with gold and precious gems, enlightened by the doctrine of their religious philosophy, and pioneered a great number of the mundane and mystical arts practiced today. At least, that’s what the saurians claim. With their numbers shrinking since before recorded time, some saurians embrace a fatalistic stance that their race was born dying. Breaking With Tradition Saurians are an isolationist and monocultural people and have been for the length of recorded history. When a saurian becomes an adventurer, they leave the highly structured society they come from and embrace a world of dizzying freedom. A saurian might take this dramatic leap because they reject the caste they’ve been born into, they’ve committed a great crime, or they’re the last survivor of a once great city-state. Whatever the reason, saurians typically know little of the customs of other people and often struggle to adopt new ways of thinking. Saurians serve adventuring parties well as historians. Saurians are long lived as individuals and, collectively, look to the past for answers to present challenges. A saurian might recall the details of how a great force of evil was contained or defeated long ago, or remember the solution to an ancient riddle. Saurian Names Every saurian is given a personal name at birth. In adolescence the saurian is taught the personal names of all of its ancestors and these form the saurian’s extended name. Saurians traditionally greet others by announcing their personal name and as much of their extended name as they can remember. Between saurians it is considered rude to list a longer extended name than someone older or in a higher social status. Ankylos Names: Bhatha, Bhima, Charma, Gada, Gadadhar, Khethah, Laguda, Sainya Deinony Names: Babila, Javana, Pathika, Rajaduta, Rewa, Turanya, Vanik, Yathu Plesios Names: Aayaata, Annapurna, Karshakka, Maalaakaara, Ogha, Puura, Riddhi, Samudra Pteradas Names: Aakaash, Aksha, Daksha, Pataga, Silpa, Vihaga, Yantram, Yukti Sarchos Names: Dawati, Hantaram, Makara, Nakra Raja, Peck, Tanupa, Udadhi, Urmi Triceras Names: Acharya, Agamya, Aparavid, Chanaakya, Gyana, Itihaasa, Katha, Vidvat Tyrannos Names: Abhiraj, Adhip, Bhayan, Mahesh, Mahiipat, Rajaan, Upadravin, Virochan Saurian Traits Your saurian shares an inheritance of traits and abilities with other saurians, passed down by your ancestors since time immemorial. Age. Saurians mature slower than humans do, reaching maturity at the age of 100, and can live up to a thousand years. Alignment. Saurians are creatures of habit and custom and are almost always lawful. Saurians have an even temperament and a dislike for trouble, making them disinclined toward good or evil. Size. Saurians are between 6 to 8 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 450 lbs. A saurian’s size varies by subrace with Pteradas being the smallest and lightest, Plesios being the tallest, and Ankylos being the heaviest. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30. Long Memory. You have proficiency in the History skill. Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. The saurian dialect of Draconic is obvious to other speakers of the language and unless you learn Draconic again from another source, your speech in Draconic will always be notable for its saurian idiosyncrasies. Subrace. Saurian society is divided into castes primarily determined by a saurian’s subraces. Ankylos are expected to become a member of the military or city guard. Deinony serve their people as ambassadors and traveling merchants. Plesios are depended on as farmers and explorers of saurian society. Pteradas are known for their creativity and expertise as artisans. Sarchos are found almost exclusively in coastal cities and often make up whatever naval forces a saurian city-state has. Triceras are encouraged to become scholars and bureaucrats. Tyrannos are the leaders of saurian society, as likely to be feared as they are admired.

They are an abomination of the world, a vile curse placed on those who peered beyond the veil and succumbed to madness. Their twisted appearance is but a mirror of the darkest recesses of their personality. All sentient creatures harbor a monster within their soul - the dark of you that resents your neighbor for having a better life than you, that hates your friends when they ignore you, that wishes to harm those that wrong you - most are fortunate enough to be able to hide this monster behind a mask of false virtues.

Those scourgeborne who embrace their inner monster, but refuse to let it rule them, often become messianic heroes within the walls of Luyarnha, attempting to redeem the entire world with their actions, and perhaps one day, themselves. “You’re a saint are you? You’ve never lied, never deceived, never resented anyone, never wanted to mangle the corpse of your enemies, never wanted to destroy their reputation? You judge me because I look like a monster, but you’re the same. You just prefer to lie to yourself.” —Martyr Tulio Scourgeborne Features Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1. Age. Scourgeborne are made not born. This means that they mature at the same rate as the race they originally belonged to. Size. Scourgeborne are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Feral Limbs. The horns, claws or fangs that you have developed due to your mutation are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. If your alignment is Evil, your feral side is more dominant and the die size for your unarmed strikes increases to a d8. Eldritch Curse. Your curse is not something mere mortals can undo. You are immune to any spell that would alter your form. (e.g., alter self, polymorph...) Born of Madness. Your body is not the one you were born with, but rather the consequence to your exposure to eldritch madness: If your alignment is Good, you gain control over your darkest impulses. You have advantage on saving throws against madness. If your alignment is Evil you let the depraved monster within you influence you. You have disadvantage on saving throws against madness but gain a bonus to Dexterity saving throws equal to your Proficiency bonus. Subraces. Your subrace is dictated by an eldritch curse, which doesn’t seem to follow a clear reasoning, although it seems that whatever aspect of your personality is most depraved will influence the beast that emerges. There are 4 subraces: Aranea, Belua, Cervus and Vespertilio.

While other elves traveled from realm to realm, sea elves navigated the currents and explored the waters of many worlds. Today these elves can be found wherever oceans exist, as well as in the Elemental Plane of Water. Like other elves, sea elves can live to be over 750 years old. Sea Elf Traits As a sea elf, you have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf. Size. You are Medium. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. Child of the Sea. You can breathe air and water, and you have resistance to cold damage. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself. Friend of the Sea. Aquatic animals have an extraordinary affinity with your people. You can communicate simple ideas to any Beast that has a swimming speed. It can understand your words, though you have no special ability to understand it in return. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Trance. You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness. Whenever you finish this trance, you can gain two proficiencies that you don’t have, each one with a weapon or a tool of your choice selected from the Player’s Handbook . You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest. Elves of Many Realms Created by the god Corellon, the first elves were Fey beings who cavorted on various planes of existence, changing their physical forms at will. Outside the glory of Arvandor, their favorite place was the Feywild—a realm of unbridled passion. It was to that place of splendors that elves fled after they were exiled from Corellon’s presence for plotting with their god’s rival, Lolth. And it was there that they transformed from Fey creatures into Humanoids and lost their ability to shape-shift at will. Afterward, they often wept as they realized what they had lost, their sorrow made even deeper by the Feywild’s influence. But in the Feywild, they also discovered the potential joys of being people of fixed forms, and they rediscovered hope once they renounced Lolth’s treachery. Most elves eventually spread from the Feywild to other worlds, as wanderlust and curiosity drove them to the far reaches of the multiverse. In those other worlds, elves developed the physical forms now associated with them. Because of their original mutable nature, each group of elves mystically took on characteristics of the environment with which they bonded, whether forests (wood elves), fey crossings in the Material Plane (high elves), the Underdark (drow), the Shadowfell (shadar-kai), the Feywild (eladrin), or oceans (sea elves). In some places, Corellon has passed from elves’ memory, but the god’s blood flows within them still, even if they know nothing of its source. That blood is what causes them to evolve after spending centuries connected to a particular environment, so it is only a matter of time before other kinds of elves emerge.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":14934},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Mordenkainen Presents - Monsters of the Multiverse"},{"name":"Sea Spawn","description":"In the Forgotten Realms, sea spawn are natives of a string of islands called Purple Rocks. The Rocklanders venerate the kraken Slarkrethel by throwing their newborns into the ocean, where they are claimed by the King of the Trackles Depths. The infants undergo a magical transformation that turns them into sea spawn, though they rarely manifest their mutations until old age. When the mutation occurs, their anatomy warps into a horrifying manifestation of the deep; barnacle covered skin, coral spurs sprouting from limbs, shark-like mouths, the variety of mutation seems endless. While most sea spawn venerate their creator after transformation, some turn against Slarkrethel for what it has done to them, seeking revenge against their old master. Sea Spawn Names Sea Spawn don’t take a new name when they undergo their transformation, meaning that those from Purple Rocks, where the majority are found, have Illuskan names. Sea Spawn Traits Your sea spawn character has the following traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1. Age. Sea spawn are humans that have been transformed by the kraken Slarkrethel. They are always over 60, and can live up to 120 years. Alignment. Due to the corruption of the kraken, sea spawn are almost always evil. Size. Sea spawn are similar in stature to humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. You base walking speed is 20 feet. You have swim speed of 30 feet. Limited Amphibiousness. You can breathe air and water, but need to be submerged in the sea at least once a day for 1 minute to avoid suffocating. Telepathic Resistance. You have resistance to psychic damage. In addition, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it. Piscine Anatomy. Part of you has been transformed through mutation. The DC for the mutations is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. Choose one of the following: Mouth. You have a shark-like mouth which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. Hair. You have poisonous quills instead of hair which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal 1d6 poison damage. A creature hit by the attack must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. Arm. One of your arms is transformed into a tentacle, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 plus your Strength modifier. A Medium or smaller creature hit by the attack is grappled (see escape DC above). Until this grapple ends, you can’t grapple another target with your tentacle. Underwater Adaptation. You ignore any drawbacks caused by an underwater environment. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Aquan and Common.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"JVC Parry","book":"Call from the Deep"},{"name":"Sentient Bloodwork Automaton","description":"Life is persistent and blood is its vessel. Even within metal veins and dead flesh, it nourishes and sustains. This chapter explains the heritages of such creatures that this animating essence has possible, fed, and marked; in Tolia, blood offers new beginnings. Sentient Bloodwork Automaton Many people think that death is the end, but it is a fresh start for bloodwork automatons. Bloodwork automatons are constructs given life by and fueled by the blood of the deceased people of Tolia. Some of them are unintelligent constructs, however some of them are no different from Tolia’s other residents. You are the latter. Bloodwork automatons are mostly created by the Kanrath and Cyherested governments. However, the state is not the only entity that can have an automaton. The nobility and the wealthy have also been known to have their own, not to mention the extremely talented scavengers or mad scientists who can build them with relatively limited resources as well. Origins of a Bloodwork Automaton Whether you were the lowest of the low or the highest of the high, a criminal or a hero, your blood now gives life to a whole new existence. Who you were is no longer important. Welcome to the fascinating world of bloodwork science. Looks of a Bloodwork Automaton Bloodwork automatons are genderless, their bodies may resemble a woman’s, or a man’s; both or neither. Their bodies are made of strong metals, and decorated with various designs, fitting the taste of their creators. Bloodwork Automatons in Society The common folk of Tolia do not take too kindly to bloodwork automatons. In general, they are deemed heartless machines, constructs that are only good for following orders and that cannot think for themselves, or simply “things” whose ideas are not worthy of consideration. However, these automatons’ role in society are of the utmost importance. They make the lives of many better thanks to their enhanced bodies and unnatural endurance. There are bloodwork automatons who’ve made a name for themselves, and become respected individuals in society, though one does not happen upon a bloodwork automaton of great repute every day. Sentient Bloodwork Automaton Traits Being a construct of blood provides you with the following features: Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age. You die when your body ceases to function. You have no average lifespan. You do not age. However, your body slowly loses its functions if you do not treat it carefully. Once every year, you have to make sure that you see a technician and pay them 1000 KF/CS to make the necessary repairs. Otherwise you suffer 1 level of exhaustion until you get them done. Alignment. All sentient bloodwork automatons think for themselves, and can vary greatly in principle and deed. They thus can be of any alignment. Size. Sentient bloodwork automatons stand at 5 to 6 feet tall and average between 300 to 500 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Type. You are a construct. Automaton Health. Since you are a special type of construct, you can choose to spend one of your Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your Constitution modifier. You can also be healed by spells specifically designed to heal automatons (p.156). Automaton Nature. Your body is made of metal, and you have no organs within. This nature grants you the following benefits. - You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage. Your body may be endurant against disease and poison, but you still function with blood. - You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe. - You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive state. - You can’t wear armor on your body. However, your construct body provides you with a certain amount of protection, which is given in each subrace. If you are using a shield, you can apply the shield’s bonus as you normally would. Fueled by Blood. Although you do not need to eat or drink, your body requires a certain amount of blood to function effectively. Once per week, you have to refill the blood tanks within your body with an amount of blood worth 5 KF/CS for each level you have. Otherwise, you starve. Purpose of Creation. Since you are created for a specific purpose, you gain proficiency in a skill of your choice, which was actually the choice of your creator. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one another language that your creator wants you to know. Subrace. Three main bloodwork automaton subraces can be found in Tolia: Scribe, Slayer, and Vanguard. Scribe Automaton As a scribe automaton, you are designed to memorize, to keep records, do calculations, and other kinds of scribing work. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Extra Intelligent. You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice, and you can speak, read, and write one other language of your choice. Lightly Armored Body. Your body provides you with an AC of 12 + your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 12 AC). Slayer Automaton As a slayer automaton, you are designed to destroy your enemies. Your physical prowess can best even the greatest of athletes. Ability Score Increase. One of the following ability scores of your choice increases by 1: Strength or Dexterity. Extra Efficiency Protocol. You can take a bonus action to activate the Extra Efficiency Protocol. Once you do, the blood inside your body is used extra effectively for 1 minute, granting you extra power. For the duration, your successful weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon’s damage type. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again. Moderately Armored Body. Your body provides you with an AC of 14 + your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 14 AC). Vanguard Automaton As a vanguard automaton, you are designed to endure damage and protect others. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1 more. Heavily Armored Body. Your body provides you with an AC of 16 + your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 16 AC). However, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Vanguard Protocol.

For 1 minute, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage as a result of an attack, you can use your reaction to take the damage instead. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest to use it again.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Dream Realm Storytellers","book":"Bloodpunk - A Guide to Tolia Campaign Setting"},{"name":"Shadar-kai","description":"Shadar-kai are the elves of the Shadowfell, originally drawn to that dread realm by the Raven Queen. Over the centuries, some of them have continued to serve her, while others have ventured into the Material Plane to forge their own destinies. Once shadar-kai were Fey like the rest of their elven kin; now they exist in a state between life and death, thanks to being transformed by the Shadowfell’s grim energy. Shadar-kai have ashen skin tones, and while they’re in the Shadowfell, they also become wizened, reflecting the somber nature of that gloomy plane. Like other elves, shadar-kai can live to be over 750 years old. Shadar-kai Traits As a shadar-kai, you have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf. Size. You are Medium. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Blessing of the Raven Queen. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn.

The world of Midgard is no stranger to ghosts and specters that linger beyond death, but sometimes a person’s passion, purpose, and will to live are so strong, their tie to the living world so unbreakable, that their memories create a vessel for their soul after their body dies. These people are called shades. Shades can arise from any living race. There are rumors of darakhul or other undead leaving shades behind after destruction, but there are no reliable accounts of such a creature. It is more likely that an undead creature with strong enough will to become a shade becomes a shade of the race they were in true life. Spirit and Flesh A shade possesses a physical body that looks, acts, and feels similar to a living member of their original race, at least superficially. Shades must breathe, consume food and drink, and require shelter from adverse weather. Despite the functional similarities to a living body, a shade isn’t composed of flesh and blood. Their bodies are a memory of who they once were, inhabited and quickened by the presence of their soul. Exhaustion, deprivation, and injury take their toll on a shade’s body, disrupting their body’s ability to maintain the connection to their soul. Food, drink, and air aren’t necessary to nourish their bodies but merely to help them maintain the sense of being a living, breathing creature. Similarly, shades appear to sleep, but they do not require it. The more injured or exhausted a shade, the less corporeal they appear. The colors of their body wash out to pale, desaturated tones, and light begins to pass through them. Blood from their wounds starts out as red and vibrant as any humanoid’s, but closer to death, their wounds cease to bleed and seem to evaporate at the edges. Living Memory The strength of a shade’s memory of themselves and their place in life is the core of their being. Newer shades are almost impossible to distinguish from their prior, fully-living selves. Like anything exposed to the gnawing ravages of time, however, memory fades. The older a shade gets, the memories that keep them tethered to the living world begin to fray. They might grow forgetful, losing track of where they are or what year it is. Their memories might drift together, causing them see people around them as figures from their past. Many shades keep detailed memoires, tending to them with the same devotion that any living creature shows seeking out food and water. Shades can theoretically live forever, but in practice, the memories that tether them to life can’t hold out indefinitely. Journals and other personal mementos help shades keep hold of themselves and allow them to last longer, sometimes for centuries. Shades in Midgard The largest known concentration of shades has arisen relatively recently in the conquered kingdom of Krakovar. The death that swept from the vampires to the south and their ghoulish allies that boiled up from the earth’s crevices created the perfect conditions for shades to arise. Despite their greater frequency, even in the new annex of the greater Blood Kingdom, shades remain scattered except for one place. A tiny village in the Ostre Hills, Werghart, hosts a community of shades. It’s remote and completely beneath the notice of the vampire ruling nobility because a scouting force destroyed it during the conquest. The shades found it not long after and set about to building themselves a new life. The Werghart shades are cut off, but they are determined and could make powerful allies in striking at the Blood Kingdom from within. In the Southlands, shades are more common in Nuria Natal and in Siwal the City of Gardens. Siwali shades are great assets to the gravebinders who oversee the Necropolis, often becoming gravebinders themselves. Shade Adventurers Because they can arise from any people, shades come from all corners of Midgard and from all walks of life. Station and wealth are no guarantee to help one linger on after the body’s death either. It’s not unheard of for a person to die only to rise as a shade with little understanding that anything changed. Some even hide or dispose of their original remains, sometimes suppressing or deeply denying the act at all, and resume their life with no disruption. Anyone could secretly, sometimes even to themselves, be a shade. Some traveling shades leave their old lives behind, particularly those who were alone in life with no one to mourn them or fuel their memory. Such shades make up the majority of adventurers. Other more established shades might set out on adventure to quest for the means to restore their true life or to protect loved ones from a threat. Krakovan shades engage in endless sabotage, harassment, and even outright warfare against the occupying forces of the Blood Kingdom. Shade Traits Your shade character has a collection of traits that arise from being a shade as well as a few drawn from life. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Choose one ability score that is increased by your Living Origin or by one of its subraces. That ability score increases by 1. Age. Shades appear as the age they were when they died. They potentially have no limit to their lifespan, but, realistically, ancient shades grow weary and lose their hold on their memories, fading away near 750 years old. Alignment. Shades come from all walks of life but show a tendency toward neutrality. Shades that lack contact with other people grow more selfish over time and slip toward evil. Size. Your size is determined by your Living Origin. Speed. Your speed is determined by your Living Origin. Darkvision. Your existence beyond death makes you at home in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Ghostly Flesh. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to dissolve your physical body into the ephemeral stuff of spirits. You become translucent and devoid of color, and the air around you grows cold. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you have a flying speed of 30 feet with the ability to hover, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren’t made with silvered weapons. In addition, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple or against being restrained, and you can move through creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you take 1d10 force damage. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Imperfect Undeath. You are a humanoid, but your partial transition into undeath makes you susceptible to effects that target undead. Though you can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds, you can also be affected by game effects that specifically target undead, such as a cleric’s Turn Undead feature. Game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, but they return you to life as a shade. A true resurrection or wish spell can restore you to life as a fully living member of your original race. Life Drain. When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell, you can choose to deal extra necrotic damage to the target equal to your level. If the creature’s race matches your Living Origin, you gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Spectral Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease, and you have resistance to necrotic damage. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language spoken by your Living Origin. Living Origin. As living echoes of who they once were, shades maintain some of the traits they bore in life. Choose another race as your Living Origin. This is the race you were in life. Your size and speed are those of your Living Origin, and you know one language spoken by your Living Origin. Memento Mori A shade’s remembrance of their own life, their own self, is the key to their continued existence. When others honor their memory, a shade can draw sustenance and strength from it. Any token, gift, or even a work of art or poetry intended to honor the memory of the shade carries the giver or creator’s memory and can sustain the shade. Creating a true memento mori requires that the creator have a genuine desire to honor the shade. It might seem trivial for a shade’s bard companion to compose poems or songs regularly, thus sustaining the shade, but such attempts fail. Memory is the key, and a creator who is in regular close contact with the shade draws more on that contact than on their own memory. A shade’s traveling companion painting a portrait of the shade during their travels will never become a memento mori, but a handmade twine bracelet given by a villager after the shade saved their village might if the shade moves on. Above all, a true, empowered memento mori must carry meaning. Memento Mori Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by the shade for whom it was offered) As long as you have the memento mori in your possession, you don’t require food, drink, or sleep. As an action, you can draw on all the stored memory at once, and you receive the effects of a potion of heroism. When the effect expires, the memento mori loses its magic.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Underworld Player's Guide"},{"name":"Shade","description":"Life leaves echoes in its wake, whether crumbled remnants of a bygone civilization, tales of heroes and gods that spawn new beliefs, or even the echo of an individual soul left behind to haunt the living world.

Any token, gift, or even a work of art or poetry intended to honor the memory of the shade carries the giver or creator’s memory and can sustain the shade. Creating a true memento mori requires that the creator have a genuine desire to honor the shade. It might seem trivial for a shade’s bard companion to compose poems or songs regularly, thus sustaining the shade, but such attempts fail. Memory is the key, and a creator who is in regular close contact with the shade draws more on that contact than on their own memory. A shade’s traveling companion painting a portrait of the shade during their travels will never become a memento mori, but a handmade twine bracelet given by a villager after the shade saved their village might if the shade moves on. Above all, a true, empowered memento mori must carry meaning. Memento Mori Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by the shade for whom it was offered) As long as you have the memento mori in your possession, you don’t require food, drink, or sleep. As an action, you can draw on all the stored memory at once, and you receive the effects of a potion of heroism . When the effect expires, the memento mori loses its magic. Shades in Midgard The largest known concentration of shades has arisen relatively recently in the conquered kingdom of Krakovar. The death that swept from the vampires to the south and their ghoulish allies that boiled up from the earth’s crevices created the perfect conditions for shades to arise. Krakovan shades engage in endless sabotage, harassment, and even outright warfare against the occupying forces of the Blood Kingdom. Despite their greater frequency in Krakovar, shades remain scattered except for one place. A tiny village in the Ostre Hills, Werghart, hosts a community of shades. It’s remote and completely beneath the notice of the vampire ruling nobility because a scouting force destroyed it during the conquest. The shades found it not long after and set about building themselves a new life. The Werghart shades are cut off, but they are determined and could make powerful allies in striking at the Blood Kingdom from within. In the Southlands, shades are more common in Nuria Natal and in Siwal, the City of Gardens. Siwali shades are great assets to the gravebinders who oversee the Necropolis, often becoming gravebinders themselves.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Tome of Heroes"},{"name":"Shadow Goblin","description":"Shadow goblins evolved to thrive in the Shadow Realm as servitors and allies of the shadow fey. In time, they founded their own city and have cut their own path. These goblins are closer to fey than they are to their monstrous cousins in the mortal lands, and they possess cunning dispositions that allow them to integrate into the shadow courts. They are often blue- or purple-skinned and with bright orange or yellow eyes. And they have a knack for blending into shadows. Good rogues and even better assassins, shadow goblins have a dark reputation but also delight in low humor, drunkenness, roughhousing and wrestling, and other feats of skill (which they often lose). Shadow goblins are masters of deception and learn from infancy to take advantage of those who would underestimate them. These creatures share the natural resistance shadow fey have to the corrupting influence of the Shadow Realm, and they demonstrate a surprising affinity for shadow weaving and lunar magic. Naturally, their knack for magic is something most shadow goblins keep as an advantageous secret. Shadow Goblin Names Individual names among the shadow goblins tend to be suggestive of either darkness or whimsy—or better yet, both—as those two facets play such important roles in their day-to-day lives. Many actually feel it a personal flaw to share a given name with anyone else, so they take great pains to name their children something entirely unique. Family names tend to focus much more on utility, another important facet to shadow goblins' lives, and are much more descriptive. Example Male Names: Bollair, Bruddaq, Desolay, Dessoto, Falko, Farsight, Fringo, Messerino, Picklo, Stinko, Thundero, Twisp. Example Female Names: Daniy, Jojoni, Lunara, Morrameko, Nona, Olara, Omagda, Pippi, Sihaddra, Tippita, Vellissa. Example Family Names: Bellringer, Butcherson, Candlesmith, Cloudchaser, Cooperson, Foxskinner, Glimmerfetch, Goldbiter, Ironbeater, Marshhound, Moonshine, Netmender, Potlicker, Potmaker, Seasalt, Shepherdsdottir, Skullsniffer, Tailshipper, Wargbender, Weaselwise, Weaverson. Shadow Goblin Traits You are a shadow goblin, forever changed by the Shadow Realm, setting you apart from most other goblins. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Age. Shadow goblins reach adulthood at age 8 and can live up to 70 years. Alignment. Much like the shadow fey they coexist with, shadow goblins are not inherently evil, despite their reputations. Their natures are a constant balance between whimsy and being useful and productive. Shadow goblins are more likely to tend toward neutral good or neutral alignments. Size. Goblins are between 3 and 4 feet tall and weigh between 40 and 80 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet as though it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Quick Wit . You have proficiency in the Deception and Insight skills. Shadow Camouflage. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in dim light or darkness. Stink Eye. As an action, you can perform a combination of rude gestures and sounds to distract one creature you can see within 30 feet. If the target can hear and see you, it must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your Charisma ability modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failure, it has disadvantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn. Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. Unseelie Blessing. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. Language. You can speak, read, and write Goblin and Umbral.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Book of Ebon Tides Compendium"},{"name":"Shadowblood Half-Elf","description":"Half-Elves in the world In the old world of Virthys, the quality of life for half-elves depended very much on where they lived. Elves and humans were very dominant species, and offspring of the two races wasn't a rare thing. Still, some nations and cultures promoted purity, and in some extreme cases, half-elves were seen as abominations. None of these nations survived the apocalypse, so half-elves in Ashandri are usually off to a better start. In Delvaroth, they are treated just like everyone else; in the swimming cities of the Ocean Heart, they're even called the Children of Light. The elven tribes in the Bleeding Jungles are wary of their mixed offspring, though, and parents often have to leave their communities with their children. Shadowblood Half-Elves The rare offspring of Shadowblood Elves and humans usually have a far darker fate than other half-elves. Not only are the humans rarely consensual partners, the children are often seen as experiments or playthings. Many Shadowblood half-elves try to flee their homelands, but most of them die trying. Some are also sent to the surface world as agents, either bound by magic or by being trained into obedience. In the realms above the ground, they're at least considered suspicious. Cities like Hag's Rest or Blackbed tolerate them, but even there, they're usually given a hard time. The offspring of Shadowbloods resemble regular half-elves in many ways, but they share the Shadowblood Elves' thick black veins. The skin sometimes looks a bit rougher and more grey than usual. Occasionally, their shadows seem to make slight movements of their own. But if you look closer, everything appears normal. Shadowblood Half-Elf Traits Replacing the Skill Versatility trait of regular half-elves, Shadowblood Half-Elves gain the Aberration Familiar of Shadowblood Elves. Aberration Familiar: All shadowblood half-elves can cast Find Familiar to summon their shadow spirit. Once used, you need a short rest before you can use this ability again. The spirit can change its shape every time it is summoned, appearing like a different creature, but its soul and memories stay the same. The summoned familiar is of the aberration type, which shows in its shape: A raven familiar could have three eyes, an octopus could have a hundred tentacles or a spider might have a fur pattern that looks like a screaming face. These aberration marks can change every time the familiar is summoned in a new shape.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Shifter","description":"Geth’s ancient heritage rose up from deep within him, spreading out from the core of his being. Some shifters manifested terrible claws, others massive fangs, still others astounding speed or heightened senses. Geth’s gift from his lycanthrope ancestors was sheer toughness. Strength seeped into his bones and flooded his flesh. His skin hardened, and his hair became coarse like an animal’s tough hide. A sense of invincibility spread through him. For the moment at least, he felt unstoppable! —Don Bassingthwaite, The Binding Stone Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they can’t fully change shape, they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features—a state they call shifting. Each shifter walks on the knife’s edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization? The Beast Within Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter’s personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter’s personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time. A shifter’s beast within is reflected by the shifter’s subrace. Four subraces are especially common: Beasthide often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn, and thick-skinned. Longtooth shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack. Swiftstride are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows. Wildhunt shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey. While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they’ll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character. Similar and Diverse Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies. The traits of the beast within affect a shifter’s appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter may have catlike eyes and delicate build, while a beasthide shifter might be a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter’s appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral. The Journey Yet to Come Shifters have a strong presence in the Eldeen Reaches but can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire, where they often live among humans. While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It’s a shifter proverb to “always be prepared for the journey yet to come,” and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity. Shifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt. A shifter rogue harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith. Shifter Names Shifters have no language of their own and often live in blended communities. Their names typically overlap with the names of other cultures in their region. Many shifters prefer to keep their personal names for their friends and use “wandering names” with strangers. These are usually tied to a physical or personality trait. Shifter Names: Badger, Bear, Cat, Fang, Grace, Grim, Moon, Rain, Red, Scar, Stripe, Swift, Talon, Wolf Shifter Traits Your shifter character has the following traits. Age. Shifters are quick to mature both physically and emotionally, reaching young adulthood at age 10. They rarely live to be more than 70 years old. Alignment. Shifters tend toward neutrality, being more focused on survival than concepts of good and evil. A love of personal freedom can drive shifters toward chaotic alignments. Size. Your size is Medium. To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier: Size modifier = 2d8 Height = 4 feet + 6 inches + your size modifier in inches Weight in pounds = 90 + (2d4 × your size modifier) Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Shifting. As a bonus action, you can assume a more bestial appearance. This transformation lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you revert to your normal appearance as a bonus action. When you shift, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You also gain additional benefits that depend on your shifter subrace, described below. Once you shift, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common. Subrace. The beast within shapes each shifter physically and mentally. The four major subraces of shifter include: beasthide, longtooth, swiftstride, and wildhunt. Choose a subrace for your shifter. Beasthide Stoic and solid, a beasthide shifter draws strength and stability from the beast within. Beasthide shifters are typically tied to the bear or the boar, but this subrace could embody any creature known for its toughness. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1. Natural Athlete. You have proficiency in the Athletics skill. Shifting Feature. Whenever you shift, you gain 1d6 additional temporary hit points. While shifted, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. Longtooth Longtooth shifters are fierce and aggressive, but they form deep bonds with their friends. Many longtooth shifters have canine traits that become more pronounced as they shift, but they might instead draw on tigers, hyenas, or other predators. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score in- creases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1. Fierce. You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. Shifting Feature. While shifted, you can use your elongated fangs to make an unarmed strike as a bonus action. If you hit with your fangs, you can deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Swiftstride Swiftstride shifters are graceful and quick. Typically feline in nature, swiftstride shifters are often aloof and difficult to pin down physically or socially. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score in- creases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Graceful. You have proficiency in the Acrobatics skill. Shifting Feature. While shifted, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, you can move up to 10 feet as a reaction when a creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This reactive movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. Wildhunt Wildhunt shifters are sharp and insightful. Many are constantly alert, ever wary for possible threats. Others focus on their intuition, searching within. Wildhunt shifters are excellent hunters, and they also tend to be- come the spiritual leaders of shifter communities. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity increases by 1. Natural Tracker. You have proficiency in the Survival skill. Shifting Feature. While shifted, you have advantage on Wisdom checks, and no creature within 30 feet of you can make an attack roll with advantage against you, unless you’re incapacitated.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":4480},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Eberron - Rising from the Last War"},{"name":"Shifter","description":"Shifters are sometimes called weretouched, as they are descendants of people who contracted full or partial lycanthropy.

In recent years, the Simic Combine has extended this research to humanoid subjects, magically transferring the traits of various animals into humans, elves, and vedalken . The goal of the Guardian Project is to build a Simic army of soldiers perfectly adapted to a variety of combat situations. These hyper-evolved specimens are called Simic hybrids, though they sometimes refer to themselves as guardians. Extensive Adaptation A hybrid’s biological enhancements can change its appearance drastically, though most hybrids retain their basic physical form. All are augmented with characteristics of animals, mostly aquatic, reptilian, or amphibian creatures. These include crab claws, squid tentacles, wings or fins like those of manta rays, translucent or camouflaged skin, or shark-like maws filled with sharp teeth. Hybrids are the product of Simic magic. It’s not impossible for a hybrid to leave the Simic Combine and join another guild, but the Simic would consider the individual a deserter. And the new guild might never fully welcome a hybrid who could easily be a Simic spy. Simic Hybrid Names A hybrid usually bears the name given by their human, elf, or vedalken parents. Some hybrids assume a new name after their transformation—a name chosen personally or by those who transformed them. Simic Hybrid Traits Your hybrid character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Age. Hybrids begin their lives as adult humans, elves, or vedalken. They age at a slightly accelerated rate, so their maximum life spans are probably reduced somewhat. The Guardian Project has not been operating long enough to observe the full effect of this phenomenon. Alignment. Most hybrids share the generally neutral outlook of the Simic Combine . They are more interested in scientific research and the standing of their guild than in moral or ethical questions. Those who leave the Combine, however, often do so because their philosophical outlook and alignment are more in line with a different guild’s. Size. Your size is Medium, within the normal range of your humanoid base race. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and your choice of Elvish or Vedalken. Animal Enhancement. Your body has been altered to incorporate certain animal characteristics. You choose one animal enhancement now and a second enhancement at 5th level. At 1st level, choose one of the following options: Manta Glide. You have ray-like fins that you can use as wings to slow your fall or allow you to glide. When you fall and aren’t incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage, and you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend. Nimble Climber. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Underwater Adaptation. You can breathe air and water, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. At 5th level, your body evolves further, developing new characteristics. Choose one of the options you didn’t take at 1st level, or one of the following options: Grappling Appendages. You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they’re both claws or tentacles. As an action, you can use one of them to try to grapple a creature. Each one is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages can’t precisely manipulate anything and can’t wield weapons, magic items, or other specialized equipment. Carapace. Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you’re not wearing heavy armor. Acid Spit. As an action, you can spray acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10).

They are famed for their beautiful voices, which they use to sing haunting lamentations, captivating listeners and transporting them to a bygone age. Sirens are rarely found very far inland. They prefer to remain near the coasts, as the gentle roar of the ocean waves calms their roiling emotions. Sirens typically experience fluctuating moods from one day to the next, ranging from extreme joy and hope for the future, to extreme sorrow and pessimism. No matter how a siren feels, she expresses her emotion through song. On good days, she may annoy her companions with chirpy melodies and vocal warm-ups as she glides around on outstretched wings. Bad days, on the other hand, may see her moaning and wailing and dragging her feet. Legend of the Sirens The sirens once lived on a great expanse of shoals in the Cerulean Gulf, where they built a city of brilliant white limestone. Its towering spires and pillars thrust out from the rocky waters, allowing the sirens to fly or swim as they pleased. They lived here in joy, singing praises to Sydon, who governed the oceans. Sydon heard this from his throne in Praxys and scowled. “Were they truly grateful, they would not build their towers to rival mine.” When the sirens learned that Sydon was displeased, they were heartbroken. They dismantled their towers and composed new melodies—songs of repentance—which once more carried on the winds to the ears of the Titan. He was unmoved. “Were they truly repentant, they would not sing so brazenly, but they would go meekly and offer the proper sacrifices in place of songs.” This time, the sirens were utterly stricken. They had believed that their songs were cherished by the gods. Their voices were stilled, and in the ensuing silence, the brilliance of the city faded into shadow. Stone foundations cracked, and pediments grew heavy. The pillars collapsed, and the city of the sirens sank deep into the ocean, swallowed by churning waters. Even its name was forgotten. Centuries passed in silence. Eventually, a new song began—an endless lamentation for the city that now sleeps on the ocean floor. When Lutheria learned that the city of the sirens had been destroyed, she laughed. She captured an entire flock of the pitiful creatures and gleefully cursed them, twisting them into something monstrous. These were the first harpies. Ocean Lovers Sirens are not amphibious, but they are well-adapted for living in and around water. They are thought to descend from an ancient Nereid who fell in love with an avian celestial. Iridescent scales cover many parts of their body, and their taloned hands and feet are excellent for fishing. They live in small flocks along the shores of the ocean. Siren artwork, poetry, and architecture emphasize their special relationship with both the clouds above and the sea below. Mournful Singers Every siren is born with an abiding sense of sorrow that never fades—a soul-crushing grief caused by the loss of her ancestral home. From an early age, sirens learn to sing the ancient songs of their lost city, which evoke heart-wrenching memories of a time that will never come again. Anyone who hears a siren’s song is immediately mesmerized by the overwhelming emotion conveyed by her beautiful voice. Some are moved to tears—others collapse into catatonia. The siren herself is not exempt from this—the moment she hears her own lamentations, she experiences an intense pang of loss. Winged Messengers Sirens have broad, feathered wings growing out of their backs, which allow them to fly like birds. For this reason, sirens are often employed as messengers, tasked with conveying satchels of written letters from one city to another. However, a siren can only fly when her heart is filled with light. On such days, her songs are bright and joyful, no matter what manner of message she carries. Thus the saying, “A siren in good spirits may yet carry ill news.” Siren Names Sirens have names that sound lyrical and sad. They are ancient names, carried down from generation to generation, and each is associated with an ancestral song. Sirens choose their own names when they come of age, selecting one from the song that moves them most deeply. Male Names : Alovar, Celeus, Everean, Gaiar, Helean, Inareus, Leiro, Meiar, Nerean, Oren, Reilan, Taeren Female Names : Alovarea, Celea, Everea, Gaia, Helena, Inarea, Leira, Meia, Nerea, Orena, Reilana, Taerena Siren Traits Sirens have the following traits. Ability Score Increase . Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1. Age . Sirens mature at the same rate as humans, but they live about five times as long. Alignment . From birth, sirens experience deep feelings of sorrow from the loss of their ancestral home. Some wish to prevent another such tragedy from befalling other races, which draws them toward good alignments. Others become bitter and pessimistic, tending toward neutral alignments. Size .

You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial. Enthralling Voice . You have advantage on Performance and Persuasion checks made with your voice. Additionally, your powerful lungs allow you to hold your breath for up to 1 hour. Wavering Emotions . Your mood affects your ability to sing and fly. After any short or long rest, you must choose whether you are feeling joyful or sad. While you are feeling sad, you lose your flying speed but gain songs of sorrow. While you are feeling joyful, you gain your flying speed but lose songs of sorrow. Your mood may change before the next time you rest, but it won’t affect which ability you have access to until after your next rest is completed. Flight . You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor. Songs of Sorrow . Your lamentations have a powerful effect on anyone who can hear them.

When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the enthrall spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the hold person spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short rest.

Suddenly, it was all a hail of blaster fire: Coalition troops had finally tracked us, and decided to take us in dead, rather than alive. I retorted with my standard carbine, blasting off a few of them as they peeked from cover. I drew my repeater and slid it over to Mor'rak. Bolts of white-hot energy whizzing overhead, he stared at the blaster blankly for a moment, one of his mandibles quivering a bit. I retaliated with a burst of automatic fire downrange, then leaned carefully over to Mor'rak, took his hand, opened his palm, and placed the repeater in it. He politely placed the repeater exactly where it has been on the floor. — Dan Bola, Space Cowboy While many civilized spacers regard Tier 3 and 4 worlds as hostile, dangerous environments, the skathári can think of no better place to call home. Hailing from the distant, mountainous world of Kopriá, whose seasons can last for years and whose volcanoes choke entire regions with sulfur gas, these insectoid creatures are perfectly adapted to life in harsh environments. Hardy Insectoids Standing upright between 6 and 7 feet tall, the hulking skathári only vaguely resemble humanoids. They have six limbs—four legs and two arms—each of them thin, lined with spines, and ending in a quartet of small hooked claws, suitable for deterring predators or climbing sheer cliff faces. Their bodies stand mostly upright, centered in a wide squat above their four legs. Their chitinous shells can be a myriad of colors, from jet black, to speckled yellow, to a scintillating emerald green. On their backs, usually folded beneath their shells, they conceal a pair of broad, membranous wings, used to glide short distances. Some skathári have stronger wings that allow them short bursts of flight, but most are too heavy to remain airborne for long. A skathári’s face appears small, framed by its hulking, hunched shell. Its iridescent compound eyes, mandible-lined mouth, and feathery antennae complete its alien appearance. Because of their hostile homeworld, skathári are well adapted to extremes, bearing scorching heat, deathly cold, and thin or poisonous atmospheres with ease. Finally, they can rapidly regenerate missing body parts, re-growing entire limbs in the course of a day. These physical traits have made the skathári extremely well-suited to live on nearly any planet. Skathári Customs A strict set of rules and customs governs skathári society and guide their everyday lives. Though traditions vary, each skathári tribe holds one more or more taboos, that, when broken, are grounds for severe punishment, including exile from the tribe. The Skathári Taboos table below can serve as an inspiration for a particular tribe’s taboo. d8 Skathári Taboo 1 The practice of arcane magic is forbidden. 2 The consumption of a particular food is forbidden. 3 When resting, you must always recite a specific prayer and sleep in a certain position or orientation. 4 You must use every part of an animal you kill. 5 You must always address those of higher social status by their full names and titles. 6 You cannot own more than you can carry. 7 You cannot bathe, or you can only bathe on certain days. 8 You are honor-bound to accept any challenge to single combat. Technophobic Perhaps the only universal taboo held by skathári is a deep and unabiding mistrust of all technology, both magical and nonmagical. Many skathári warriors would fight unarmed with their claws and mandibles, rather than raise a blaster or laser sword in their defense. Even technology as simple as windmills earns their ire. This taboo seems to stem from a general skathári skepticism of anything too complicated to understand at a glance, and extends to most forms of magic. Skathári especially regard conjuration, illusion, and enchantment magic as they do most technology: with skepticism and occasional fear. Since the skathári joined the galactic community, exceptions to this taboo have been made out of necessity: journeys on spacefaring vessels are tolerated, as long as they are no longer than necessary, and some skathári will wield blasters in dire straits. Generally, however, the skathári place their trust in straightforward things, like the strength of their tribes and the heft of their clubs. Adventuring Skathári Sometimes, a skathári might abandon their tribe for a life of adventure. In rare cases, this course of action comes from an uncharacteristic case of wanderlust or a longing for excitement. More often than not, however, a skathári takes up adventuring involuntarily, after being exiled or otherwise separated from their tribe. Skathári Names A skathári has a single given name, usually passed down from a prominent ancestor. Throughout their lives, skathári also accumulate titles based on their deeds and accomplishments, which they append at the end of their names as honorifics. The oldest and most well-respected skathári typically have gathered a long list which must be recited to greet them with respect. Skathári Names. Bmarsk, Drikt, Fraxas, Ruzkor, Skrath, Turur, Xast, Xebraks Skathári Titles. Bearer of Scars, Dragon-Slayer, Far-Glider, Faster than the Rest, Lifter of Boulders, Master of Swords, Rider of Beasts, Spear-Thrower, Wood-Carver Skathári Traits Skathári have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increases. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age. Skathári reach maturity around 15 years of age and live for up to 150 years. Alignment. Skathári are fierce, impulsive fighters with an innate distrust of the outside world. They tend toward chaotic alignments . Size. Most adult skathári stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh upwards of 200 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Adaptive Metabolism. Your body can quickly adapt to a range of extreme environments. You take no damage from the extreme temperatures of space and other harsh environments, and you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 10 times your Constitution modifier (minimum of 10 minutes). Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against inhaled poisons and gases. Gliding Wings. You have a pair of membranous wings that you can use to glide clumsily through the air. While falling, you can move up to 10 feet horizontally for every 5 feet you fall, up to your movement speed. Additionally, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage taken as a result of falling. Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Hooked Claws. Your digits end in short, hooked claws, which grant you a climbing speed of 20 feet. Additionally, you can choose for your unarmed strikes to deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage. Regenerative. If any part of your body is amputated, but its amputation doesn't kill you, you can fully regrow that part of your body in 24 hours. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Skathári. Skathári is a choppy, syllabic language that uses many idioms and metaphors. This carries into other languages a skathári might speak; therefore, speaking to a skathári in any language is often a chore if one doesn’t know much about skathári culture.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Mage Hand Press","book":"Dark Matter Starter Kit"},{"name":"Snowcap Adult","description":"Snowcaps are a race descended from Humans who lived in the heights of Icehelm and the icy tundra of northern Ne’Oor. They are culturally and biologically distinguishable from neighboring populations of other races that have Human ancestry, although they are nearly indistinguishable by sight other than their style of dress. Due to the particularly harsh environment of often below-freezing temperatures, Snowcaps have adapted to living in the cold and making use of their natural surroundings for survival. As hunter-gatherers, their way of life is centered on hunting, raising large herd animals, and fishing, living off fatty meats and using the hides and furry pelts of what they hunt as outerwear and blankets to protect against freezing temperatures. Through generations of acclimation to the snow, Snowcaps have a natural tolerance for any cold temperature above freezing. While many Snowcap tribes are nomadic, searching for new areas where their animals can graze or finding others to trade goods with, most keep to their villages hidden in the icy hills, living in caves in the high reaches of Icehelm and the mountain passes. Hardy Hunters Culturally, traditional Snowcap life has adapted to an extremely cold, snowbound environment in which vegetation is almost nonexistent, trees are scarce, and caribou, sea mammals, and fish are the major food sources. These high-fat food sources also provide resources for illumination (burning oil), cooking oil, tools, and weapons made from bones. Grasses, tubers, roots, stems, berries, and seaweed are collected and preserved, depending on the season and location, but very little of these foods are consumed compared to the meat that is hunted. Most fruits and vegetables are nearly non-existent in the Snowcap diet, and those who venture to the marketplaces in villages and farmlands find these foods quite exotic and valuable. Because meat is their main source of food, Snowcaps are proficient at hunting, using harpoons and spears to kill seals and whales from the shores or in boats. Inland, Snowcaps learn to hunt caribou and other land animals with bows and arrows and how to ice-fish from a very young age. Snowcap Names One of the customs following the birth of a Snowcap infant is for a tribal elder to place a tiny ivory carving of a dragon into the baby’s mouth in the hope that this will protect the child from the dangers described above. After the ritual, their parents would venture outside, even in a snowstorm, and look to their surroundings for inspiration, convinced that DexMya will send a sign for a strong name. Thus, many children born in the winter have snow-themed names, while those born in spring or summer are named after other aspects of nature.

Snowcap Wardlings always range from Lawful Good to full Neutral. Size . Snowcaps are generally a bit more robust in build, as their added layers of fat and muscle keep them warmer in cold temperatures.

","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Renegade Game Studios","book":"Wardlings Campaign Guide"},{"name":"Specter","description":"While the cosmic order dictates that the spirits of the dead are meant to travel to the afterlife, wherein they are judged and eventually reincarnated, some choose not to pass on. Whether they are benevolent spirits attempting to aid their comrades or fulfill some great purpose, malevolent specters hell-bent on punishing those who wronged them, or morally neutral ghosts with their own earthly attachments, specters are the subject of many folk tales in Rokugan. Sometimes, a swell of sentiment can even cause a living being to create a specter to pursue their repressed desires or try to fulfill dreams that the owner cannot. Physiology Specters are supernatural beings, but they appear to be living humans most of the time. However, there are certain telltale signs that a person might in fact be a specter. Failure to breathe for long periods of time, tendency to vanish and reappear at odd moments, and conspicuous lack of feet are all signs that more superstitious folk in Rokugan look for when considering whether someone is a specter. Specters can dispense with their corporeal form at will, fading into a mist, a gust of snow-flecked wind, or pale motes of fire before vanishing. However, doing so draws the specter further from the mortal coil, and returning from the brink can be difficult. Additionally, flagrant use of such powers is likely to attract the attention of the underworld bureaucrats responsible for the shepherding of souls—mazoku. Ghostly Pursuits Each spirit has its own reasons for existing, whether it desires to pass on but is trapped by its sentiments or persists so that it can achieve some goal. These goals are likely the key to the specter achieving the sense of fulfillment they need to move on to the afterlife. Specter Traits As a specter, you benefit from the following: Ability Score Increase . Choose two ability scores to increase by 1. Age . You might have died recently, or you might have lingered in the afterlife or the Mortal Realm for centuries. Size . You are roughly the size you were in life, which is Medium. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Ghostly Dispersal . When you are hit by an attack, you can spend your reaction to disperse your corporeal form, granting you resistance against that attack’s damage then causing you to fade into mist or motes of pale flame before vanishing entirely along with all items on your person. You can also spend your action to disperse. When dispersed, your creature type is undead instead of humanoid, you are invisible, and have immunity to all non-psychic damage and all conditions. If you were previously suffering a condition, you can remove it until you reincorporate. You cannot act directly upon your surroundings. You observe the world as if through a supernatural haze, which imposes disadvantage on your checks to perceive your surroundings may cause you to miss key details at the GM's discretion. You still occupy your previous position, but cannot be perceived by mundane senses. You can be seen with truesight or other abilities that can see through invisibility, and your presence in the general vicinity can be felt by the spiritually attuned, such as with a DC 14 Intelligence (Religion) check. Your only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. You can move through solid objects of 1 inch or thinner, provided they are not warded against the passing of spirits, but if you end your turn inside of an object, you suffer 1d6 psychic damage. You cannot attack, perform invocations, or take any action other than to reincorporate yourself, returning to your physical form along with all of your items. Once you have dispersed and reincorporated, you cannot disperse again until you complete a short rest. Pull of the Afterlife . Being dispersed pulls you closer to the afterlife, and you start to slip from the mortal realm if dispersed too long. At the end of each of your turns, if you began the turn dispersed, you must use your action to reincorporate unless you choose to suffer 1d6 psychic damage, plus 1d6 additional psychic damage for each round you have delayed rematerializing beyond the first. If you are dispersed outside of a combat encounter, you suffer this increasing damage every minute you are dispersed instead. If your hit points are reduced to 0 this way, you count as being killed (see Queue of the Dead ). Queue of the Dead . You are not alive, so you cannot die in the traditional sense. However, if you are killed (in any of the usual manners a PC could be), you vanish back to the Realm of Waiting, leaving only your items behind. There, you must wait until your soul is judged and processed (which can take hundreds of years), or until you get another chance to escape (which can also take hundreds of years). Barring exceptional circumstances, being killed removes you from the campaign just as it would any other PC. Spiritual Anchor . During a long rest, you can form a spiritual bond with one willing living creature (such as another PC in your party, provided they are not also a mazoku or specter), designating that creature as your spiritual anchor. If you are within 30 feet of your spiritual anchor, you ignore your Pull of the Afterlife feature. Additionally, even while you are invisible due to being dispersed, your spiritual anchor can perceive you. You can have only one spiritual anchor at a time. Watchful Presence . If you are within 30 feet of your spiritual anchor, you can choose to disperse and remain dispersed during a long rest. Instead of sleeping, you remain conscious, watching over your allies, and you can wake your spiritual anchor or return to your physical form at will. As long as your spiritual anchor completes that long rest, you count as completing a long rest. Language .

They were clearly created by dragons, some as slaves, some as willing servants. Free dragonborn not serving a dragon were a rare sight, even if not completely unheard of. At some point during ancient history, most dragonborn were abandoned by their masters, left to live a life of their own. Still, some dragons still keep dragonborn servants (or slaves) to this very day. Many of them fought in the war of the dragon gods, when Zathruax sent his draconic armies all over the world. Countless dragonborn died - on both sides. But among the survivors, many have lost their former masters either on the battlefield or in the apocalypse itself. Still, after all that happened, this species is not exactly welcome in many areas of Ashandri. Their ties to the dragons, some of which were directly responsible for the end of the world, makes people wary, sometimes even outright hostile. Even heroes who fought against the forces of the apocalypse often have a hard time, especially in areas where they aren't well-known. Spellvessel Dragonborn Dragonborn are, originally, an artificially created race in Ashandri. Nobody knows how it’s done, except for the dragons. And some of them developed a few extra tricks. Spellvessel Dragonborn are not only infused with draconic essence, but with pure arcane force, as well. The creation process must be painful and horrible: Spellvessel that were not born, but created, remember their first moments as excruciating, burning and hurting. They don’t remember anything else, but every single one of them shares these first memories. Galtheac Yaldrazi, Chief of Mission of the Arcanists responsible for researching the Bloodhaunt Forest This is also the reason why the creation of Spellvessels is frowned upon by good-aligned dragons. But even for those who were born, the result of two of these dragonborn mating, the infant seems to suffer an imprinted reflection of this pain. For every Spellvessel dragonborn, life begins with pain and suffering. But it doesn’t end after birth. Not just because their masters were usually evil dragons, treating them as slaves and cannon fodder. The magic within them is alive. As it was bound to their soul, the arcane force fused with them, turning into a living and thinking partial entity of its own. Fortunately, not all of these living spells are evil or try to dominate their vessels. Still, it’s true for the majority. There are even rumors that the dragon masters sought and killed those with a more friendly spellvoice in their heads. Imagine having a cruel voice in your mind from the very first days of your existence, constantly telling you that you’re worthless, that you should obey, that you’re never good or strong enough to be free. Most Spellvessel dragonborn grow up constantly hearing such messages, and it shapes their personality. Which comes in handy for the dragons that have an easy time dominating these poor souls. When the apocalypse freed those Spellvessel dragonborn slaves that were lucky enough to survive, most of them had no idea what to do with their life. They never learned to act on their own, they have few social skills (unless they were specifically trained for it), and hearing a voice in your head doesn’t exactly make you less socially awkward. Many of them became mercenaries or even assassins. This put them into positions where they could continue following orders while earning what they needed for survival. And in these jobs, few people care to ask questions if you act weird. There are exceptions, of course: Those who survived despite having a more friendly, possibly even helpful voice; those who managed to see through the lies the voice told them; and those who decided to fight for a life of their own, no matter how bad their starting position was. Traits Spellvessel Dragonborn can resemble Dragonborn of any draconic ancestry. This ancestry does not influence their abilities. The only visual difference is that Spellvessel Dragonborn are so infused with magic that arcane energies shine through the cracks between their scales. The light is subtle, but visible, and often resembles a color matching the character's Spellblood Power or their ancestry. A Spellvessel shares most traits with the typical Dragonborn. The following traits replace the Ability Score Increase and Damage Resistance Traits. Ability Score Increase: Intelligence+2, Dexterity+1 Age: Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80. Alignment: Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with evil can be terrible villains. Size: Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Spellblood Power: Magic is infused in your blood. You are born capable of casting one first-level spell, with no components required. You choose this spell at character creation from the wizard spell list, and you can never change it. Any saving throws made by a target of your spell has to beat a DC equal to 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Once cast, you can’t use this ability again until you’ve had a long rest. Sensing Magic: By touching and focusing on one item, you can sense whether it is enchanted or magical. The ability works similar to a Detect Magic spell, only limited to this particular object. You can sense magic a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (Minimum 1) per long rest. Arcane Breath Weapon: Instead of a regular breath weapon resembling your draconic ancestry, you can breathe out pure arcane force. Using an action, you release a whirlwind of confusing lights and patterns accompanied by a cacophony of sounds in a 15 ft. cone. The effects resemble those of a Confusion spell, and targets have to succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw to resist the effect. The DC for the Wisdom Saving Throw is 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. The duration is limited to 3 rounds, but you do not have to concentrate on it. After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a Long Rest. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest Languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language Sounds harsh to most other Creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Spiritfarer Erina","description":"The erina are a race of bipedal folk that resemble hedgehogs. Originally hailing from the Bright Lands, the shadow fey brought erinas along as servitors when they first came to the Shadow Realm, where they quickly adapted to the shadows and have learned to thrive in the dark forests and underground warrens. Their natural propensity for exploration and their unrivaled burrowing skills mean that they've tunneled their way to many a strange new locale—including the mortal realms. They've primarily settled around the plateau that hosts the Queen's Wood and the Silver Hills, but regular bands of explorers, naturalists, and wilderness guides have established underground camps throughout the realm. The shadow fey are not entirely pleased by the erinas' wanderlust (making them less than entirely useful servants) nor with their open policy of assisting travelers in and out of the Shadow Realm through their underground shadow roads. However, at least for now, it is easier for the shadow fey to ignore these aspects of the crafty survivalists. Spiritfarer erinas are a subrace of erina. You can find out more about the base erina race in Tome of Heroes . Erina Names Erina names translate very poorly into other languages. When outside erina lands, the hedgehog-folk tend to adopt names with long, open vowel sounds. These sounds are rare in their own language and bring pleasure to their ears. Erina are certain to extend the vowel sounds in their names when introducing themselves. Example Names: May-nay, Wayee, Leemay, Einore, Die-Nu, Lowno, Ur-win. Erina Traits You are a spiritfarer erina, whose ancestors were forever changed by the Shadow Realm, setting you apart from most other erina. You exhibit a few different traits from typical erinas. The following traits include those shared with the base erina's traits (see Tome of Heroes ), though replacing the Ability Score Increase, Hardy, Spines, and Keen Senses traits with those listed. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and you can choose to increase either your Dexterity or Charisma score by 1. (This trait replaces the base erina's Ability Score Increase trait.) Age. Erina reach maturity around 15 years and can live up to 60 years, though some erina burrow elders have memories of events that suggest erina can live much longer. Alignment. Spiritfarer erina are good-hearted and extremely social creatures with an oversized sense of wonder. They have a difficult time adapting to the laws of other peoples, but they cherish the bonds of their communities. They tend more toward neutral and lawful alignments. Size. Erina average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 50 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet as though it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Digger. You have a burrow speed of 20 feet, but you can use it to only move through earth and sand, not mud, ice, or rock. Quills. Your spines are longer and more potent than other erinas. Whenever you make a successful melee attack against a target within 5 feet of you, that target takes an additional 3 (1d6) piercing damage. (This trait replaces the base erina's Spines trait.) Sharp Instincts. You can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. (This trait replaces the base erina's Keen Senses trait.) Spirit Tongue. You have an innate knack for speaking to the spirit world. You know the message cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the charm person spell with this trait (targeting only undead creatures), and starting at 5th level, you can cast the enthrall spell with it. Once you cast a non-cantrip spell with this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Languages.

Though often confused for ghosts, spirithosts are very much alive—as much as their shifting, partly material bodies allow. Ethereal Progeny The Ethereal Plane is rightly believed to be the domain of restless, transient souls. However, the Border Ethereal, which lies closer to the Material Plane, has its fair share of adopted inhabitants, such as the blink dog and phase spider. Spirithosts are the only humanoids to have adpoted this plane, and might be considered its only true descendents. Though their bodies resemble that of ghosts—slightly translucent and glowing with a pale, white light—spirithosts are not undead. Far from it: they are born, grow old, die, and can even raise children. Yet the stigma of undeath lingers over them. Many a well-meaning but ignorant cleric or paladin has tried to turn or banish a spirithost to no avail. To avoid such conflict, spirithosts often avoid large, unfamiliar towns, or disguise their ethereality from others. Spirithosts do not experience time in the same way as most mortal creatures. As a result, even though they mature in their teens, their lives can stretch on for hundreds of years. Spirithost Traits Your borderline ethereal body grants you the following traits: Ability Score Increase. Increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Typical: Strength +1, Dexterity +1, Intelligence +1 Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. However, spells and effects that specifically affect Undead affect you as well, except for effects that turn undead. Size. You are Medium. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Ethereal Vision. While you are on the Material Plane, you can see 120 feet into the Ethereal Plane. Ghostly Descent. You float gently to the ground. At the end of a fall when you aren’t incapacitated, subtract 60 feet from the distance you fell when calculating your falling damage. Incorporeal Movement. You can move through other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. You can also move through solid objects, but your partially material form can’t pass through more than one foot of stone, one inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. If you end your movement occupying the same spot as a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. Spirit Speech. You can cast the speak with dead spell, without requiring a material component. When you cast the spell using this trait, you can ask the corpse a number of questions equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can’t cast the spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell when you cast it with this trait (choose when you select this race).","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Mage Hand Press","book":"Valda's Spire of Secrets"},{"name":"Squatch Adult","description":"“The honeyguide leads the badger to the beehive with its flight. The badger spills the honey with its strength. Working together, both get a sweet prize.” - Curto of Sandsvigor, Squatch elder The Squatch are forest-dwelling people, descended from the early Humans of Ne’Oor. They have long hair, ranging from nearly white blonde to deep black in color, often covering most of their body. Squatch warriors take pride in their grooming, often braiding their hair into intricate patterns, dyeing it to denote tribal affiliation or rank, and weaving trinkets, trophies, and beads of various significance into their hairstyles. Typically on the taller range of Human variants, the Squatch have muscular builds and slightly pronounced brow ridges on their foreheads. Squatch have powerful builds, reflected especially in their broad shoulders and thick chests. Their extreme strength and long fingers allow them to climb trees well, where they are able to hide and hunt in the forest canopy. Many Squatch villages are groupings of treehouses bordering the many wooded areas of Ne’Oor. One with Nature The Squatch have a close affinity with nature, living mainly in the forest among the Fey and other magical beings. Squatch villages are communal in practice, with each member of the tribe having specific duties that contribute to the whole. Meals and social activities are shared by entire tribes as a whole, and while adults perform their duties, the children gather in a “family hut” where they are all raised together and spend most of their time learning, playing, and sleeping. Parents spend three to four hours a day in the afternoon with their children after work and before dinner. While a basically peaceful and non-confrontational society, most Squatch are raised to be wary of outsiders, due to the outsiders’ judgment on their way of life. However, this way of life allows the Squatch to connect with each other and themselves without too much distraction, tapping into the Oor more easily. Squatch who live in these communal tribes in the woods tend to discover their Wardling abilities at an early age of four or five years old, but those who take on too many tribal duties often lose their abilities before adulthood. Squatch Names Squatch names are typically simple and short, with hard consonants and short vowels such as long Os (pronounced “oh”) and soft As (pronounced “ah”), which are commonly stressed in their speech, even when speaking Common. Squatch rarely take on last names and instead define themselves by the community village in which they were raised, which are generally named after their location or village mission.

They have long hair, ranging from nearly white blonde to deep black in color, often covering most of their body. Squatch warriors take pride in their grooming, often braiding their hair into intricate patterns, dyeing it to denote tribal affiliation or rank, and weaving trinkets, trophies, and beads of various significance into their hairstyles. Typically on the taller range of Human variants, the Squatch have muscular builds and slightly pronounced brow ridges on their foreheads. Squatch have powerful builds, reflected especially in their broad shoulders and thick chests.

","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Renegade Game Studios","book":"Wardlings Campaign Guide"},{"name":"Strig","description":"Strigs are the most imposing of the birdfolk races. Resembling owls, their thick feathers, solid bodies, and broad wings have earned them a reputation as the most powerful of the birdfolk races. They value strength and endurance, traits they believe crucial for survival in the Wood. Although they are not necessarily prejudiced against those who are weaker, strigs are quick to call out when someone is not doing their best for the common good. Strong and Brave While many birdfolk rely on their prowess or intelligence for superiority, strigs use their immense strength and stamina to endure even the most punishing assault. They make mighty warriors, and whether defending their perch or braving the Wood itself, strigs never shy away from a fight. Strig culture is largely based on principles of strength and endurance above all, but not necessarily for the purposes of combat. Protecting and providing for others in hard times is considered just as impressive, if not more so, than winning a fight. Woodland Survivors Strigs, more than any of the other birdfolk race, are most at home in the wild. Their mottled feather patterns, though not as bright or beautiful as others, allow them to easily hide in the forest. Due to this inherent advantage, along with their speed and power, strigs make excellent hunters and rangers. Strigs prefer the relative simplicity of the forest to the machinations of society and politics. Despite these individualistic tendencies, they are capable of forming familial and community bonds that transcend a permanent or single physical home. Strig Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2. Age. Strigs reach maturity faster than most birdfolk races, around 15 years. They can reach a respectable old age by birdfolk standards, living around 80 years. Alignment. Strigs are normally good aligned, having a strong sense of fair play as well as a tendency to see the best in others. They also favor chaotic alignments, as strigs are a freedom-loving people who will usually put their personal morals above any imposed system of governance. Size. Strigs are muscular, imposing folk ranging from 4 to over 5 feet tall and weighing around 110 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Glide. Using your feathered arms, you can slow your fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose, although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you are encumbered. Talons. Your sharp claws aid you in unarmed combat and while climbing. Your damage for an unarmed strike is 1d4 piercing damage. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb any surface your talons could reasonably grip. Darkvision. You are adept at hunting under the cover of night. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Patterned Feathers. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when you attempt to hide in a forest. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk. You can also understand Auran, though you cannot speak it naturally. Subrace. There are two main subraces of strigs: swift and stout . Choose one of these subraces.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Hit Point Press","book":"Humblewood"},{"name":"Stygian Shade","description":"The River Styx winds through the Shadow Realm, full of mindless shades that live only to consume the memories of those they can drown. An unfortunate few of these shades bound to the plane retain their mental faculties yet suffer daily to recall who they once were. Shades from the Shadow Realm are different from those of the mortal realms because they specifically lack most of their memories, and the drive to find what was lost propels them. Newly born shades are difficult to distinguish from ghosts, but most settlements in the Shadow Realm are familiar enough with the phenomenon to recognize a new shade when they stumble into town with no recollection of where they came from. The city of Soriglass has become a haven for various undead, and shades congregate there in large numbers. It is often called the City of Shades. And a small community of shades have set up camp near the River Styx in hopes of preemptively finding and guiding the unfortunate individuals who wander out of its waters. This growing community is dedicated to helping shades of the Shadow Realm and to gathering resources to help its members discover who they once were. Stygian shades are a subrace of shades. You can find more about the base shade race in Tome of Heroes . Stygian Shade Names Shades of the Shadow Realm awaken with little to no memory of who they were in life and rarely know their own names. Rediscovering one's name is a huge piece of reclaiming identity, so shades that do learn their own names use them with pride. For shades who don't yet remember, they often choose and discard different names for themselves as they attempt to find something that feels familiar. Stygian Shade Traits You are a Stygian shade, your identity stripped by the waters of the Shadow Realm, which sets you apart from most other shades. You exhibit a few different traits from the shades of the mortal lands. The following traits include those shared with the base shade's traits (see Tome of Heroes ), though replacing the Ability Score Increase, Size, Life Drain, and Living Origin traits with those listed. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. (This trait replaces the base shade's Ability Score Increase trait.) Age. Shades appear as the age they were when they died. They potentially have no limit to their lifespan, but realistically, ancient shades grow weary and lose their will to hold onto reality, fading away near 750 years old or so. Alignment. Stygian shades come from all walks of life but tend toward neutrality. Those that can't recover their memories or grow to resent their condition often drift toward evil alignments. Size. Choose whether you are Small or Medium sized. (This trait replaces the base shade's Size trait.) Speed. Your speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet as though it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Death Mask. As an action, you can strip away your veneer of life and expose your true spectral face. All non-undead creatures within 30 feet that can see you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to your Death Mask for the next 24 hours. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Constitution modifier. (This trait replaces the base shade's Life Drain trait.) Ghostly Flesh. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to dissolve your physical body into the ephemeral stuff of spirits. You become translucent and devoid of color, and the air around you grows cold. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you have a flying speed of 30 feet with the ability to hover, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't made with silvered weapons. In addition, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple or against being restrained, and you can move through creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you take 1d10 force damage. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Imperfect Undeath. You are a humanoid, but your partial transition into undeath makes you susceptible to effects that target undead. Though you can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds , you can also be affected by effects that specifically target undead, such as a cleric's Turn Undead feature. Effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, but they return you to life as a shade. A true resurrection or wish spell can restore you to life as a fully living member of your original race. Mysterious Origin. Stygian shades are born with almost no memory of their former lives but have an innate desire to remember who they are. When you create your stygian shade, decide which one of these questions you know the answer to. The rest are questions you seek to answer: What is your name? Where are you from? Who were the people you loved most? How did you die? What unfinished business has caused you to rise as a shade? (This trait replaces the base shade's Living Origin trait.) Spectral Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease, and you have resistance to necrotic damage. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Umbral and one other language of your choice. Stygian Shades Like other shades, stygian shades fade away as the remembrance of them becomes distant. But unlike those other shades, stygian shades, those shades that arise from the waters of the Shadow Realm, remember almost nothing of their previous lives, and they frequently strive to recover even the slightest detail of who they once were, collecting clues about their own past. Stygian shades can still benefit from memento mori (see Tome of Heroes ), and these can be one key in these characters regaining their memories.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Book of Ebon Tides Compendium"},{"name":"Subek","description":"The kindly, scholarly subek come from a river-based culture, known for advising others and lending their physical and intellectual prowess to local projects. During flood season, however, the subek become violent and territorial. Subek adventurers often wish to break away from the ebb and flow of the river and discover in the process some control over their destructive nature. Subek dwell along the banks of the major rivers in warm climates. In the Southlands, the river Nuria shelters several communities of subek, as do the Selwheyha and the Amaja. Subek Names Subek adopt names similar to other races in whatever region they dwell. Subek Traits Your subek character has certain characteristics in common with all other subek. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and you choose one of the following to increase by 1: Strength, Intelligence, or Wisdom. Age. Subek age at roughly the same rate as humans but mature faster, reaching adulthood around the age of 10. They can live up to 300 years. Alignment. Subek possess a wide range of alignment, just as humans do. The ties to the natural pattern of their river homes tend to push many subek toward lawful or neutral alignments. Their Flood Fever (see below) has an impact on this. Size. Adult males can reach a height of 8 1/2 feet with females averaging 5 inches shorter. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet and your swim speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Natural Weapons. Your powerful bite and sharp claws are natural weapons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, your bite deals 1d8 + your Strength modifier piercing damage and your claws deal 1d6 + Strength modifier slashing damage. Hold Breath. Accustomed to your watery home, you can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes. Flood Fever. Choose three consecutive months out of the year to reflect the flood season of your river birthplace. During this time, you lose the benefits of your Scholars trait (see below). When a creature deals damage to you, every attack you make and harmful spell you cast must include that creature as a target, until you drop to 0 hit points, your target falls to 0 hit points, or you are unable to make an attack against it for 1 minute. Once per turn when you hit your target with an attack, you deal an additional 1d6 damage. Scholars. When it is not flood season, you have advantage on Intelligence (History) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks. Languages.

These ravenfolk call themselves Seekers of the Sublime and reportedly are drawn by a mysterious psychic song. Their numbers are still few, but more arrive along the shadow roads from the mortal lands regularly, waiting for the unknown singer to reveal their intentions. This network is highly secretive about the details of their mission, but so far, they have not conducted open hostilities against the other peoples of shadow. Sublime ravenfolk are a subrace of ravenfolk. You can find more about the base ravenfolk race in Midgard Heroes Handbook . Sublime Ravenfolk Names As with many other races whose native language is difficult for more humanlike vocal organs to deal with, ravenfolk tend to use different names among humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoids than they use among their own kind. When choosing human-friendly names, ravenfolk borrow liberally from local traditions, mythology, and popular songs and poetry. They prefer evocative names (like Starshadow, Moonglow, and Rainshimmer) over more prosaic labels, but that's as much consistency as it's possible to define. Since these aren't their real names, ravenfolk have little attachment to them. Sublime Ravenfolk Traits You are a ravenfolk mysteriously drawn to an unknown source within the Shadow Realm, which sets you apart from most other ravenfolk. You exhibit a few different traits from typical ravenfolk. The following traits include those shared with the base ravenfolk's traits (see Midgard Heroes Handbook ), though replacing the Ability Score Increase, Mimicry, Sudden Attack, and Trickster traits with those listed. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1. (This trait replaces the base ravenfolk's Ability Score Increase trait.) Age. Ravenfolk reach adulthood at 10 years of age and can live to be 110. Alignment. Sublime ravenfolk more often tend toward lawful alignments than their cousins in the mortal world. They tend to seek stability and connectedness in their relationships, entrusting their path to the song. Size. Ravenfolk are slighter and shorter than humans. They range from 4 feet to just shy of 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Constant Tune. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. (This trait replaces the base ravenfolk's Sudden Attack trait.) Cosmic Musician. You have proficiency in the Performance skill and gain proficiency with one musical instrument of your choice. (This trait replaces the base ravenfolk's Trickster trait.) Sublime Chord. As an action, you can mimic the mysterious sublime song to attempt to charm creatures within range. All creatures within 30 feet that can hear you must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become charmed by you for 10 minutes. The charmed creatures regard you as a friendly acquaintance. A creature makes this saving throw with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.

Compared to common humans, sylvans have much thicker body hair in specific places: on the men’s chest and back, on women’s groin, and on the arms and legs of both; their head is often covered in a thick mane of hair. Their body is more agile and muscular, their features fiercer and their mettle tougher. Apart from these characteristics, the difference between humans and sylvans is almost exclusively cultural: traditionally, sylvan tribes and families do not build shelters of brick or stone, nor do they work the land or raise livestock: they are hunter-gatherers and live exclusively in pristine natural environments. Their lore is typically oral, and they know as many stories and songs by heart as those read or written in books by humans. Though very different from “civil” culture, theirs is anything but primitive, having a wealth of rituals, beliefs, techniques, and traditions. Fun Nicknames: animals, beasts, brutes, savages. Typical Male Names: Guriut, Ircus, Irsat, Ospel, Pantogan, Picat, Ravat, Scrat, Selvan, Soran, Sur, Urcat. Typical Female Names: Baguta, Bragola, Canenta, Cavatha, Deverra, Fana, Feronia, Ghera, Luperca, Menara, Selena, Uriah. Surnames and Assorted Titles: sylvans don’t have actual surnames, but often take on distinguishing nicknames or epithets, such as “Tall Tom”, “Big Bill”, “Wilfred the Wolf”, “Titan Tim”, “Woody Will”. How Other Races See Them In the days of the Draconian Empire, sylvans were considered primitive, mindless troglodytes, or even human-animal hybrids or werebeasts. For this reason, they were often hunted and taken captive as monsters or circus phenomena. Over the last few centuries, however, tensions between surviving pockets of these people and common humans have eased off. These days, sylvans have integrated with ordinary Kingdom humanity, one way or another: whether as isolated communities, or as families that live in the wilds, or as individuals welcomed in villages or companies, or even as famous characters, these beings are no longer considered “monsters”, primitive beasts, freaks of nature, or myths, but simply people: a little hairy, unfriendly and grumpy, perhaps, but still people. Sylvan Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, your Wisdom score increases by 1, and an ability score of your choice different from the previous ones increases by 1. Age. The life expectancy of a sylvan is identical to that of a human, although sylvans remaining faithful to their communities' traditional lifestyle have a higher mortality rate and appear to age earlier. Size. Sylvans are the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Raised in the Forest. You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena. Primal Instinct. You have proficiency in the Perception and Survival skills. Brawl Feature: Tough Guy. During a brawl, you ignore the side effects of the first two levels of Whack.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Acheron Games","book":"Brancalonia - Core Rulebook Compendium"},{"name":"Tabaxi","description":"We had a tabaxi come through once, a few winters back. She kept the taproom packed each night with her stories and spent most days napping in a chair in front of the fireplace. We thought she was lazy, but when Linene came around looking for a missing broach, she was out the door before I could blink an eye. —Toblen Stonehill, innkeeper Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tabaxi are catlike humanoids driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts, gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world’s wonders. Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long. Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost. Wandering Outcasts Most tabaxi remain in their distant homeland, content to dwell in small, tight clans. These tabaxi hunt for food, craft goods, and largely keep to themselves. However, not all tabaxi are satisfied with such a life. The Cat Lord, the divine figure responsible for the creation of the tabaxi, gifts each of his children with one specific feline trait. Those tabaxi gifted with curiosity are compelled to wander far and wide. They seek out stories, artifacts, and lore. Those who survive this period of wanderlust return home in their elder years to share news of the outside world. In this manner, the tabaxi remain isolated but never ignorant of the world beyond their home. The Cat Lord The deity of the tabaxi is a fickle entity, as befits the patron of cats. The tabaxi believe that the Cat Lord wanders the world, watching over them and intervening in their affairs as needed. Clerics of the Cat Lord are rare and typically access the Trickery domain. Barterers of Lore Tabaxi treasure knowledge rather than material things. A chest filled with gold coins might be useful to buy food or a coil of rope, but it’s not intrinsically interesting. In the tabaxi’s eyes, gathering wealth is like packing rations for a long trip. It’s important to survive in the world, but not worth fussing over. Instead, tabaxi value knowledge and new experiences. Their ears perk up in a busy tavern, and they tease out stories with offers of food, drink, and coin. Tabaxi might walk away with empty purses, but they mull over the stories and rumors they collected like a miser counting coins. Although material wealth holds little attraction for the tabaxi, they have an insatiable desire to find and inspect ancient relics, magical items, and other rare objects. Aside from the power such items might confer, a tabaxi takes great joy in unraveling the stories behind their creation and the history of their use. Fleeting Fancies Wandering tabaxi are mercurial creatures, trading one obsession or passion for the next as the whim strikes. A tabaxi’s desire burns bright, but once met it disappears to be replaced with a new obsession. Objects remain intriguing only as long as they still hold secrets. A tabaxi rogue could happily spend months plotting to steal a strange gem from a noble, only to trade it for passage on a ship or a week’s lodging after stealing it. The tabaxi might take extensive notes or memorize every facet of the gem before passing it on, but the gem holds no more allure once its secrets and nature have been laid bare. Tinkers and Minstrels Curiosity drives most of the tabaxi found outside their homeland, but not all of them become adventurers. Tabaxi who seek a safer path to satisfy their obsessions become wandering tinkers and minstrels. These tabaxi work in small troupes, usually consisting of an elder, more experienced tabaxi who guides up to four young ones learning their way in the world. They travel in small, colorful wagons, moving from settlement to settlement. When they arrive, they set up a small stage in a public square where they sing, play instruments, tell stories, and offer exotic goods in trade for items that spark their interest. Tabaxi reluctantly accept gold, but they much prefer interesting objects or pieces of lore as payment. These wanderers keep to civilized realms, preferring to bargain instead of pursuing more dangerous methods of sating their curiosity. However, they aren’t above a little discreet theft to get their claws on a particularly interesting item when an owner refuses to sell or trade it. Tabaxi Names Each tabaxi has a single name, determined by clan and based on a complex formula that involves astrology, prophecy, clan history, and other esoteric factors. Tabaxi names can apply to both males and females, and most use nicknames derived from or inspired by their full names. Clan names are usually based on a geographical feature located in or near the clan’s territory. The following list of sample tabaxi names includes nicknames in parenthesis. Tabaxi Names: Cloud on the Mountaintop (Cloud), Five Timber (Timber), Jade Shoe (Jade), Left-Handed Hummingbird (Bird), Seven Thundercloud (Thunder), Skirt of Snakes (Snake), Smoking Mirror (Smoke) Tabaxi Clans: Bright Cliffs, Distant Rain, Mountain Tree, Rumbling River, Snoring Mountain Tabaxi Personality A tabaxi might have motivations and quirks much different from a dwarf or an elf with a similar background. You can use the following tables to customize your character in addition to the trait, ideal, bond, and flaw from your background. The Tabaxi Obsession table can help hone your character’s goals.

Tabaxi in the Forgotten Realms In the Forgotten Realms, tabaxi hail from Maztica, a realm located far across the ocean west of the Sword Coast. The tabaxi of Maztica are known for their isolation, and until recently they never ventured from their homeland. The tabaxi say little of why that has changed, though rumors persist of strange happenings in that distant land.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Volo's Guide to Monsters"},{"name":"Tabaxi","description":"I once met the Cat Lord.

I don’t know, I don’t. I was wee then. But I tell you truth, there’s a stirring when I look up at that mountain. A longing. One day I may have to wander thataway. That’s why I keep to the Sea, my back to Turnfjall as much as I can.\" —Jrodis, quartermaster of the Waterdrake, longship of the Risa Since the Exodus, tales of enormous men and women appearing in the forests of Turnfjall have spread. Over time a community of these large humanoids have formed a clan of their own—the Risa. The true origins of the tallfolk are not known, but some say that their ancestors were originally found alone in the great woods standing in the shadow of the mountain Turnfjall. Legends suggest that they were children stolen from a race of even larger men and women living high in the slopes of that ancient mountain. And who were these thieves that conspired to steal the children of giants? Some believe it was the Ironwood Witches themselves. Children in the Woods Though most tallfolk are born in the Risa community, a child is still occasionally found orphaned in the forests of Turnfjall. Almost always these orphans are brought to the Risa and join the clan. Like Giants Most tallfolk come close to (or slightly exceed) 10 feet in height, and they weigh several hundred pounds. Strong and hardy, they are as intelligent and skilled as other raiders. Perhaps more so. Generations of feeling like they did not quite fit in with the other clans has instilled in them a fierce desire to overachieve. Humble and Worried Many tallfolk, as they age, begin to hear whispers… a faceless voice whose words are never heard clearly. Yet the meaning is inescapable: the voice urges them towards violence and anger, and often towards the mountains of Turnfjall. And so, they counter-balance that with a gentleness that belies their great size. But those that anger the tallfolk always reap consequences. Tallfolk Names In general, the names are very similar to other raider names. For those that are raised on their own, or in more unusual circumstances, they may have more unique names. Names: Artog, Blar, Dwat, Haw, Mon, Nock, Nuna, Rima, Rowl, Spar, Stroth. Tallfolk Traits The tallfolk have the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Age. Tallfolk age slightly slower than humans, reaching adulthood in their early twenties and living a little past one hundred. Size. Your size is Large. Speed. Your base walking speed is 35 feet. Bulky . Your larger size allows you to double the range of any thrown weapon and add +1 to its damage. Additionally, when you make a melee attack, your reach is increased by 5 feet. All clothing and armor costs 50% more to make. Breaking Point. When hit, you may use your reaction to attack the opponent that damaged you (with advantage). However, using Breaking Point tires you and your initiative is reduced by 10, starting on the next round, for the remainder of this battle. You may use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. After that you must finish a long rest to use this trait again. Giant Ancestry (Subrace). Pick one of these of the following subraces: Earth or Cold . This subrace will grant additional special traits. Earth-child Brown or black skinned, these are the predominant tallfolk and are the only tallfolk most raiders have ever encountered. Camouflage. You gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in rocky or mountainous terrain. Cold-child These tallfolk have a blue tinge to their skin and tend to be slightly larger than earth-children, hinting at a different ancestry. Other tallfolk are less welcoming of cold-children and they seldom hold any important position within the Risa. Frostborn.

While some tengu may serve in these functions, the truth is that they are a species with individuals as varied as humans. Tengu inhabit the distant peaks of the northern mountains in larger numbers than anywhere else in Rokugan, but they are quite rare in all parts of the Emerald Empire. Few humans in Rokugan ever consciously glimpse a tengu, for a single fleeting sight of one flying high in the sky might easily be mistaken for the tengu’s smaller cousins, the birds. Physiology Tengu are feathered, tall hominids with great wings, taloned hands, and the heads of birds. They usually range in height from five to six feet, though some are much larger and others are much taller. Because of their feathers and hollow bones, they tend to be lighter than most humans of comparable height. They are capable of both gliding on their physiology alone, but their natural kinship with air spirits is what allows them to gain lift when it might otherwise be impossible. In terms of plumage, tengu range in hue and feather pattern as widely as their smaller avian counterparts. Some have striking feathers like peafowl and pheasants, while others have plumage of more muted colors, evoking crows, ravens, and other corvids. Tengu speech is generally birdlike, and ranges from the sonorous chirping of a songbird to the croaking register of a crow depending on the individual. Illusory Powers Illusory glamours, often called Masks of Air, allow tengu to walk among the people of Rokugan unnoticed. In order to assume human form, one must recite an ancient incantation while donning a particular piece of human clothing; the resultant illusion casts a veil over the reciter that makes them appear and sound like a member of another species. The illusion fades when the specific piece of clothing is removed. While transformed, a tengu’s native physical appearance transliterates to their illusory human form: scars, features, and distinctive marks on a tengu body persist in their human body. The harsh tengu voice softens to accommodate human speech, and the glamoured tengu feels human to the touch. Tengu Traits As a tengu, you benefit from the following: Ability Score Increase . Choose two ability scores to increase by 1. Age . Tengu are physically mature in their late teenage years, and most live less than a century. However, tengu can in theory live considerably longer, with some individuals living centuries. Size . Tengu stand about the same height as an adult human, with most falling in the range of five to over six feet tall. You are Medium. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You can also glide using your wings, giving you a flying speed of 60 feet that cannot be used to ascend unless you have access to an upward air current, such as the one created by the surge of air invocation. Grace of Winds . You can spend your bonus action to call upon the air spirits to perform the surge of air invocation, gaining 3 bonus favor to spend on its empowerments. This favor is lost if it is not spent. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest. Mask of Air . After you complete a long or short rest, you can disguise yourself to appear as a member of another Medium size species (such as a human). This guise maintains various distinguishing features of your tengu form and voice, but appears to be the chosen species for all intents and purposes. You must have a piece of clothing commonly worn by members of that species to perform this illusion, and the clothing becomes part of your outfit. When you use your flight speed or Grace of Winds feature, your disguising glamour immediately vanishes. To see through this illusion, a creature must make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check with DC equal to 12 + your proficiency bonus. Language .

Once again, the aboleth dreamed of that pathetic warrior and his dopey grin. What an embarrassment it was to dream of defeat at the hands of such a lighthearted fool. Ssussothis’ anger leached from the aberration’s body, filling the cavern with a hideous squelching sound. The aboleth sluggishly opened its three eyes to find an intruder standing in a pool of ectoplasmic goo. The slimy, grey-skinned humanoid was beaming at Ssussothis, a wide gap-toothed grin stretching across a chinless face. The being’s three vertically stacked red eyes blinked, and they waved a fleshy, sword-shaped tentacle. “Are you my mama?” asked the eager lucidling. When sleep meets the sleepless, lucidlings are born. The unwanted offspring of immortal aberrations, lucidlings burst forth from the dreams of ancient aboleths and other alien beings, where uncontrolled thoughts beget life. Odd Offspring No two lucidlings are alike. When the Vizier of the Court of All Flesh, Lord Rall, inverts the fragile flesh of a dozen enemies, his dreams might be so filled with their screams that it inadvertently spawns several lucidlings at once. A trained eye—one unfortunate to have seen a plethora of aberrations—can identify the lucidlings’ lineage based on physical characteristics, but similarities among lucidlings with the same parent are typically far and few between. Though all lucidlings are humanoids, one lucidling might be smooth and spindly with a single piercing eye, while their “sibling” could be twice as large, with a purple leathery hide speckled with tiny barbs. In addition to physical features, lucidlings inherit diluted personality traits from their creators. A lucidling descended from a dominating aboleth may be described as controlling or manipulative, while the child of a gibbering mouther might be loquacious and greedy. Despite these patterns in their psyche, lucidlings are hardly replicas of their creators. They are unique individuals, shaped by their environments, choices, and experiences. Whole New World Paranoid progenitors reduce many lucidlings to dust shortly after their inception, but not all aberrations attempt to destroy their accidental handiwork—and those that do are not always successful. A surviving lucidling might become a dutiful minion, bizarre apprentice, or loyal spy. Others manage to escape their creators’ lairs before the aberrations wake. Lucidlings begin life as fully-formed adults with alien appearances and little or no concept of organized humanoid society. Once exposed to the outside world, curiosity overwhelms most lucidlings, driving them to partake in the best and worst experiences life has to offer. Lucidling Vestiges Every lucidling is born with a vestige, an organic structure that points to their otherworldly heritage. The Lucidling Vestiges table contains examples of physical features you can add to give your character a more alien appearance. These structures have no effect on your character’s game statistics. Lucidling Vestiges d8 Vestige 1 Eyestalks 2 Translucent skin 3 Irregularly shaped iris 4 Glow-in-the-dark bones 5 Beak concealed by tentacles 6 Extra pair of tiny arms 7 Shriveled wings 8 External organs Lucidling Names Lucidlings are genderless. They typically adopt the name of their parental aberration, followed by a suffix synonymous with the muse of their birth dream. Lucidlings often choose an abbreviated nickname to accommodate creatures who do not speak their progenitor’s language. Example Lucidling Names . Albezuro-Gel (Abegel), Krizeth-Gel (Krigel), Krizeth-Mawpt (Kript), Marthekh-Khan (Markh), Xapkiro-Laxx (X-Lax) Lucidling Traits Your lucidling character has the following traits. Ability Score Increase Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Age Lucidlings reach maturity at the time of their creation, but their lifespans vary wildly. Some lucidlings live less than a year, while others are seemingly immortal. Lucidlings do not age. Alignment As products of unchecked creativity, lucidlings tend towards chaotic alignments. Size Lucidlings range from 4 to 7 feet tall and weigh between 100 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Spontaneous Evolution As an action, you can assume an otherworldly form, choosing from the following options. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes, until you die, or until you revert to your normal form as a bonus action. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Alien Appendages . You sprout a pair of tentacles, arms, or similar appendages. Each appendage has a reach of 10 feet and can lift a number of pounds equal to three times your Strength score. You can use a bonus action on your turn to perform a simple task with one of your appendages, such as: lift, push, pull, or interact with an object or creature; grapple a Large or smaller creature; or make an unarmed strike. Your GM might allow you to perform other tasks with your appendages. Your appendages can’t wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell. Psionic Propulsion . You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. Supernatural Secretion . You secrete a viscous magical slime, granting you the ability to breathe underwater and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal poison damage equal to half your level to the attacker. Telepathy You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If the receiving creature can speak at least one language, it can respond to you telepathically. Languages You can speak, read, and write Common and Deep Speech.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"MCDM Productions","book":"Arcadia Issue No. 3"},{"name":"The Sandspeaker","description":"Azita clasped her hands together and leaned forward on her oaken desk inquisitively. It was littered with books, notes, and drawings devoted to sleep and the power of the subconscious. “What did you dream of last night?” she asked the young prince. “I didn’t dream of anything,” replied Moshen. “So you forgot?” “Sometimes I just don’t dream.” He shrugged. “We always dream,” asserted the scholar, reaching for a thin purple book with gold stars along its spine. She slid it across the desk to Moshen. “Unless they’re stolen from us.” Formed from the sands of island shores in the astral sea, sand speakers look like sauntering humanoid sculptures stretched from dyed glass. They infiltrate the minds of creatures in their sleep, acting as prophetic messengers and so-called “thought thieves” on behalf of extraplanar entities. Children of the Sands Before recorded time, archangels warred with aberrations at the bounds of the multiverse, where astral sands slowly spilled into nothingness. Led by Oneirus the Eternal, the angels sought to drive back the unfathomable evils and prevent the aberrations from disrupting their divine works. During a cataclysmic battle, Oneirus’ radiant fire scorched the iridescent sand, giving it form and infusing it with life. Humanoid figures of molten glass, the original sand speakers, rose from the astral desert and knelt before the archangel. Oneirus invited each sand speaker to pledge themselves to a righteous cause and return with the angels to the celestial host. Many accepted and became prophetic messengers, while others decided to explore their newfound freedom, wandering the sands like interplanar nomads. Some, however, were tempted by unintelligible whispers emanating from the Abyss, rejecting Oneirus in favor of maleficent beings lurking beyond the sands. Extraplanar Emissaries Despite their smooth complexion, sand speakers are composed of millions of tiny granules suffused with cosmic energy. Sand speakers travel the multiverse in service to meddling archfey, imprisoned fiends, and forgotten deities hoping to reassert their godhood. Some conduct divine outreach as heralds, while others tempt sleeping souls on behalf of ambitious devils. A sand speaker might appear before a belligerent zealot, chastising their actions in hopes of averting a holy crusade without a single casualty. Some sand speakers, called thought thieves, engage in subconscious subterfuge, slipping into the minds of influential figures to steal precious secrets or plant the seed of an idea in hopes of prompting action in the material world. Expert thought thieves are graceful shadows, sneaking past the defenses of well-guarded noble estates, fortified prisons, and the magically warded towers of paranoid mages. The ability to dream walk is both a blessing and a curse. Distrusted as violators of the unconscious mind, sand speakers carry a stigma wherever they go. Perpetual Vagabonds Sand speakers typically relocate after appearing in a creature’s dreams to avoid scrutiny. While some prefer hidden lairs on the outskirts of civilizations or adopt a regular disguise, most sand speakers are vagabonds, constantly on the move to minimize the odds of being recognized by a former target. Sand speaker societies are rare, and take the form of caravans or mobile camps. Boundless Perspective By the time a sand speaker reaches maturity, they have seen dozens of dreams. However, a sand speaker’s ability comes at a price: the first time that they dream walk, they can no longer have dreams of their own. Instead, they must live vicariously through the fantasies of others, beholding the wonder of the unrestrained mind but tasting none of its fruits for themselves. Dream walks inspire sand speakers to explore the real world. To a sand speaker, each dream is an illusion— alluring, foreign, and hollow. They observe delicious foods, wondrous curiosities, and breathtaking landscapes imagined by dreamers. Sand speakers chase these visions during their waking hours, venturing out into the world in search of iconic landmarks, gourmet recipes, and famous individuals that inspired dreams they’ve visited. Sand Speaker Personalities Though sand speakers lose the ability to have new dreams after their first dream walk, they can still relive old ones. In sand speaker culture, these old dreams are symbols of fate called omens. Typically, the same omen recurs for weeks, months, or years. A sand speaker has no control over which omen they experience each night and always recalls it perfectly upon waking. Like tarot card readings or casting runes, a sand speaker draws meaning from their omen, believing it holds some hidden clue to their destiny. The Sand Speaker Omens table displays possible omens for your character, while the Sand Speaker Quirks table contains specific quirks to help you portray them. Sand Speaker Omens d8 My omen involves a… 1 Vault filled with treasures from a distant land. 2 Simple memory shared with a loved one who’s no longer around. 3 Recurring symbol which I do not recognize. 4 Battle against formidable foe. 5 Mysterious creature. 6 Famous person I have never actually met. 7 Test of great importance. 8 Horrible nightmare. Sand Speaker Quirks d8 Quirk 1 Your body is shaped like a round-bottom flask. 2 Sand shifts beneath your glassy skin, changing color to reflect your mood. 3 You have a phobia of water. 4 When someone wrongs you or your companions, you discretely fill their belongings with sand. 5 You are a thrill seeker, chasing the passion you’ve witnessed in others’ dreams. 6 You look for meaning in every action or symbol. 7 Others often mistake you for someone they know. 8 You talk in your sleep.

Ability Score Increase Your Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma scores each increase by 1. Age Sand speakers reach maturity at the same rate as humans. On average, they live about 300 years. Alignment Sand speakers tend towards lawful neutral. Tapping into the subconscious minds of other creatures gives sand speakers a sense of perspective. They see creatures in their most vulnerable states, witnessing their brightest hopes, deepest desires, and darkest fears. Size Sand speakers have smooth, elongated features. They range from 6 to 8 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 250 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Sandform As an action, you, along with everything you are wearing and carrying, transform into fine sand for 1 minute. This effect ends if you are reduced to 0 hit points. While in this form, you retain your walking speed and lose all other movement speeds you have. You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. You gain resistance to nonmagical damage. You can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects you were carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. You can’t attack or cast spells. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Oneiromancy You know the message cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the sleep spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the silence spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Dream Walk As an action, choose a sleeping creature that you can see within 10 feet of you. You enter a trance state for up to 8 hours, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, you are aware of your surroundings, but can’t take actions or move. You appear in the target’s dreams and can converse with it as long as it remains asleep, for the duration of your trance. If the target wakes during your trance for any reason, your trance immediately ends. You can’t shape the target’s dreams or alter your appearance when you dream walk—you are only a visitor. You can emerge from the trance at any time, ending this effect early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. Entering Dreams The Dream Realm does not abide by the laws of the material world, so sand speakers hoping to gain information must think outside the box. For example, in real life, the ability to read—be it a book, a sign, even a clock—is not processed in the subconscious part of the human brain, therefore we are unable to read in our dreams. While a dozing creature might believe it’s reading, a sand speaker inside the dream may come across inscriptions written in gibberish or books filled with blank pages. Similarly, creatures in dreams are products of the dreamer’s subconscious and may look or sound differently than who the dreamer understands them to be—if they have a face at all! Knowing this information can help GMs and players convey dreams as distinct, vivid experiences with unique problems for characters to solve. Languages You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"MCDM Productions","book":"Arcadia Issue No. 3"},{"name":"The Somnian","description":"As I fell into my sleep, The stage was set with wondrous things. At long-lost mem’ries, I did weep, And missed the creatures in the wings. —Bibis Ross, “The Theatre of Sleep” Somnians are the creators of dreams. Compassionate artists and philosophers, the star-skinned illusionists find meaning in all things. Whether guiding a sleeping creature towards a source of inspiration or warning it when it has gone astray, somnians are the architects of bedtime’s wildest fantasies—and worst nightmares. Imaginative Illusionists Somnians hail from the vast expanse of the Dream Realm, where time slows and their innate magic is magnified. When a creature falls asleep, a somnian in the Dream Realm weaves a dream for them, uniquely tailored to the slumbering creature’s thoughts and feelings. Outside of the Dream Realm, a somnian’s ability to create dreams manifests as illusion magic. Despite this, somnians maintain their desire to mold the world around them, using their gifts to inspire others, uphold symbols of good, or seek justice. They are natural philosophers, gravitating towards callings that emphasize expression and interpretation, such as the arts, academia, or soothsaying. Cosmic Shepherds Every dream has a purpose. Inspiration. Remembrance. Realization. In the Dream Realm, somnians discern this purpose and gently suggest it to the creature through symbolism. Somnians continue to foster others in the material world, studying and nudging creatures towards their goals with subtle enthusiasm. There is no greater joy for a somnian than helping someone else achieve their dreams. Lasting Memories Somnians are known for their generosity. The frequent gift givers expect nothing in return, sparking lifelong friendships with sculptures, songs, and recipes. Superstitious folk believe it’s bad luck to turn down a somnian’s gift. In a true act of selflessness, a somnian can give their life to resurrect a fallen creature. All that remains of a somnian who performs this act is a memory of their choosing in the mind of the revived. While they typically sacrifice themselves to resurrect a loved one, somnians have imparted their last gifts to influential poets, scholars, and leaders who died before their time. Bereaved family members sometimes seek a somnian in desperation, hoping the dreamweaver will trade their life for that of a stranger. Somnian Nightmares As stewards of the sleeping, somnians are generally pleasant. However, every somnian harbors a mote of darkness they can harness, assuming nightmarish forms to terrify misguided creatures and foes alike. The Somnian Nightmares table contains examples of possible forms your character might take when invoking this darkness. Somnian Nightmares d6 Nightmare 1 Horrifying monster with too many joints 2 Panicked reflection of the target with their teeth falling out 3 Natural disaster, like a forest fire or tsunami 4 Swarm of insects, rodents, or other pests 5 Disapproving loved one 6 Empty, emotionless void Somnian Names Somnians look like humanoid galaxies. They have shadowy frames sprinkled with tiny luminescent stars. Somnians derive their names from the constellations on their twinkling frames. Example Somnian Names . Arietes, Aquila, Belator, Gladius, Leo, Ridera, Ocula, Papilonus, Zelotes. Somnian Traits Your somnian character has the following traits. Ability Score Increase Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Age Somnians begin life as wispy spirits and reach maturity around the age of 30. They can live to be 500 years old. Alignment As the sculptors of dreams, somnians emphasize imaginative freedom. They value expression and understanding and reject reality when it is oppressive. Somnians tend towards chaotic good. Size Somnians are the same height and build as humans. Your size is Medium. Speed Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Empath You have proficiency in the Insight skill. Astral Architect You know the minor illusion cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast detect thoughts once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast major image once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Nightmare As an action, you assume a terrifying form. Choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Remembrance You can cast the resurrection spell once with this trait, requiring no material components. When you do so, you immediately die, and your body withers away in a cloud of starry dust. The resurrected creature awakes with a memory of yours (chosen by you). A somnian who sacrifices themselves in this way can only be brought back to life by a wish spell.

Their bodies are encased in protective chitin. They can alter the coloration of this carapace to blend in with their natural surroundings. Although thri-kreen don’t sleep, they do require periods of inactivity to revitalize themselves. During these periods, they are fully aware of what’s happening around them. Thri-kreen speak by clacking their mandibles and waving their antennae, indicating to other thri-kreen what they are thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this method of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. To interact with other folk, thri-kreen rely on a form of telepathy. Thri-kreen Traits As a thri-kreen player character, you have the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Monstrosity. Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Chameleon Carapace. While you aren’t wearing armor, your carapace gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity modifier. As an action, you can change the color of your carapace to match the color and texture of your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in those surroundings. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of yourself as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

That is the burden of every tiefling. Some break under it, some make it the millstone around their neck, some revel in it.” He tilted his head again, scrutinizing her, with that wicked glint in his eyes. “You fight it, don’t you? Like a little wildcat, I wager. Every little jab and comment just sharpens your claws.” —Erin M. Evans, Brimstone Angels To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable. Infernal⁠ Bloodline Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal⁠ heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple. Self-Reliant and Suspicious Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect. Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life. Mutual Mistrust People tend to be suspicious of tieflings, assuming that their infernal⁠ heritage has left its mark on their personality and morality, not just their appearance. Shopkeepers keep a close eye on their goods when tieflings enter their stores, the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while, and demagogues blame tieflings for strange happenings. The reality, though, is that a tiefling’s bloodline doesn’t affect his or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply very aware of how people respond to them. After dealing with this mistrust throughout youth, a tiefling often develops the ability to overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation. Tiefling Names Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings born into another culture typically have names reflective of that culture. Some have names derived from the Infernal language, passed down through generations, that reflect their fiendish heritage. And some younger tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, adopt a name that signifies a virtue or other concept and then try to embody that concept. For some, the chosen name is a noble quest. For others, it’s a grim destiny. Male Infernal Names: Akmenos, Amnon, Barakas, Damakos, Ekemon, Iados, Kairon, Leucis, Melech, Mordai, Morthos, Pelaios, Skamos, Therai Female Infernal Names: Akta, Anakis, Bryseis, Criella, Damaia, Ea, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Nemeia, Orianna, Phelaia, Rieta “Virtue” Names: Art, Carrion, Chant, Creed, Despair, Excellence, Fear, Glory, Hope, Ideal, Music, Nowhere, Open, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Sorrow, Temerity, Torment, Weary Tiefling Traits Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal⁠ descent.

A tiefling (pronounced TEE-fling) is linked by blood to a devil, a demon, or some other Fiend. This connection to the Lower Planes is the tiefling’s fiendish legacy, which comes with the promise of power yet has no effect on the tiefling’s moral outlook. A tiefling chooses whether to embrace or lament their fiendish legacy. The three legacies are described below. Abyssal The entropy of the Abyss, the chaos of Pandemonium, and the despair of Carceri call to tieflings who have the abyssal legacy. Horns, fur, tusks, and peculiar scents are common physical features of such tieflings, most of whom have the blood of demons coursing through their veins. Chthonic Tieflings who have the chthonic legacy feel not only the tug of Carceri but also the greed of Gehenna and the gloom of Hades. Some of these tieflings look cadaverous. Others possess the unearthly beauty of a succubus, or they have physical features in common with a night hag, a yugoloth, or some other Neutral Evil fiendish ancestor. Infernal The infernal legacy connects tieflings not only to Gehenna but also the Nine Hells and the raging battlefields of Acheron. Horns, spines, tails, golden eyes, and a faint odor of sulfur or smoke are common physical features of such tieflings, most of whom trace their ancestry to devils.

Revelation 12:9 After Lucifer and his legions were cast down for their sins, they did not only form the legions who populate Hell, but also sought to infiltrate human society in order to gain support for the anticipated last battle. One of the demonic strategies was the creation of a new mixed species. Be it with the help of illusions, by brute force or means of temptation, they mated with humans, thus producing a species that is neither infernal nor human: the tieflings, or profondi as they call themselves in Italy. (The adjective profondo refers to “deep” both in a geographical and a spiritual sense. I profondi means “the deep ones”. Profondo and profonda are the singular masculine and feminine forms.) In some ancient cultures – amongst them the Romans – the offspring of humans and fallen angels were described as intermediaries who alerted men and women to the consequences of wrongdoings and thereby helped them to do right. They were seen as beings who exist between worlds and are neither evil nor good. But Christianity has finally demonised this inconveniently different species, which is why tieflings will shun human company, either living in remote regions, forgotten ruins or deep underground cities. Most will only come out by night, and only those who can pass, are permitted to interact with humans so as to protect their kin from being expelled or killed as demons. They are bound by a strict code to never reveal their racial identity. The existence of the profondi is therefore known to very few humans, like certain clerics, scholars or people with a magical background. Profondi can make very interesting and tragic characters. They by no means have to be evil, but will often be gripped by inner turmoil because of their dark heritage. Although many of them will choose to engage in dubious professions, not all follow the paths of thieves, murderers or necromancers. Becoming a merchant is very unlikely for them, but there are scholarly profondi who try to find answers in science or philosophy to cure their mental suffering. Profondi come with a traditional knowledge of the hellish regions, and will feel intrinsically uncomfortable in Churches, cloisters or around holy people. That said, they might well quell their fears in order to seek out deeper knowledge or salvation. Tieflings – Profondi Traits Appearance. Over the years, the infernal blood has thinned in many profondi families as they continued mating with humans. This has an influence on their appearance. Although older family members of tiefling characters might look very much as described in the rulebook, profondi player characters will only have very small horns and tails, all of which can easily be hidden by hair or clothing. Their skin color will either be in the normal human range or it can have an “odd” look: a bit too white, too dark, slightly green or gray as if ill, or a bit redder than the usual person. Their eyes can look a bit eery, very dark or light, but never golden or of another unnatural color. Also, no fangs please! Even the most inconspicuous profondi will still be met with suspicion due to their “foreign” or “weird” looks. There is also a tendency to look increasingly more demonic the older a profondo or profonda gets. This is why tieflings active in human society will usually not be older than 40 or 50. Odd fact. Several ancient profondi families continue breeding with the agents of Hell in order to strengthen their blood or – if this is not possible – to mate only with family members to avoid a deterioration of the typical tiefling traits. Such pure profondi will live much longer than humans but are liable to disabilities and deformities. Because of their even more conspicuous looks, we strongly discourage choosing them as player characters, but they will of course make wonderful NPCs. Languages. Apart from the human language of the country they live in, tieflings can understand and speak the original infernal language, which is a dialect of the angelic tongue. Many also study other ancient languages like Latin, old Greek, Hebrew or Aramaic. Religion. Profondi believe in a slightly altered version of the Catholic faith. This makes sense, as their very existence is explained by it. But contrary to common interpretation, most do not agree with the predictions of a final apocalypse as the battle between good and evil. Instead, they believe that Satan and his legions play an important role in cleansing the souls of the sinners and will therefore be rewarded when the time comes.

In truth, tortles are an ancient and long-lived people who dwell within the jungles and along the beaches of the Menagerie Coast. Most tortles who journey far from the coast begin to feel pangs of homesickness, which can develop into a depression. Tortles are almost unheard of beyond the sunny shores of the Menagerie Coast. Life of a Tortle A tortle hatches from a thick-shelled egg and spends the first few weeks of its life crawling on all fours. Its parents, old and near death, spend what little time they have left telling stories to their offspring. Within a year, the young tortle becomes an orphan, though not before it learns to speak and to survive on its own. A young tortle and its siblings inherit whatever tools, weapons, and gifts their parents left behind. Each young tortle is expected to fend for itself. It leaves the place of its birth and finds its own corner of the wilderness in which to hunt, catch fish, and get by. With each passing year, a tortle hones its survival skills. It forms friendships with its neighbors while also respecting their privacy. At some point, a tortle feels an urge to see more of the world. It gathers up its gear and travels, returning months or years later with stories of its exploits. When a tortle nears the end of its lifespan, it seeks out a mate. Tortles lay their eggs (numbering as few as one or as many as a dozen) in a fortified compound. If no such compound exists, they build one. The parents spend the remainder of their lives guarding it, defending their offspring, and sharing their knowledge.

Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Claws. Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Hold Breath. You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren’t natural swimmers, but they can remain underwater for some time before needing to come up for air. Natural Armor. Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn’t affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield’s bonus as normal. Shell Defense. You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can’t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can’t take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.

In truth, tortles are an ancient and long-lived people who dwell within the jungles and along the beaches of the Menagerie Coast. Most tortles who journey far from the coast begin to feel pangs of homesickness, which can develop into a depression. Tortles are almost unheard of beyond the sunny shores of the Menagerie Coast. Life of a Tortle A tortle hatches from a thick-shelled egg and spends the first few weeks of its life crawling on all fours. Its parents, old and near death, spend what little time they have left telling stories to their offspring. Within a year, the young tortle becomes an orphan, though not before it learns to speak and to survive on its own. A young tortle and its siblings inherit whatever tools, weapons, and gifts their parents left behind. Each young tortle is expected to fend for itself. It leaves the place of its birth and finds its own corner of the wilderness in which to hunt, catch fish, and get by. With each passing year, a tortle hones its survival skills. It forms friendships with its neighbors while also respecting their privacy. At some point, a tortle feels an urge to see more of the world. It gathers up its gear and travels, returning months or years later with stories of its exploits. When a tortle nears the end of its lifespan, it seeks out a mate. Tortles lay their eggs (numbering as few as one or as many as a dozen) in a fortified compound. If no such compound exists, they build one. The parents spend the remainder of their lives guarding it, defending their offspring, and sharing their knowledge. When the children grow up, they pick up whatever weapons and tools their parents left behind and set out on their own. Tortle Names Tortles prefer non-gender-specific names that are usually no more than two syllables. Tortles don’t have surnames or family names.

They are insectoid humanoids, operating under a shared consciousness and most often hostile or uncaring toward all non-tosculi. A fearsome and ruthless insectoid queen rules each hive city, sending her drones to raid for living captives to act as hosts for the next generation of drones. The Hiveless With the constant murmur of the hive queen in their minds, tosculi are born with an unshakable sense of purpose and belonging. Occasionally, though, a tosculi is born who does not hear the voice of the queen and possesses a trait anathema to the hive: individualism. Known as the Hiveless, these tosculi do not fit into the well-tuned social mechanics of the hive. They resist the orders of the queen and thoughts of the hive mind. Others are physically unsuited to the tasks for which they were bred and are cast out. Whatever the reason, they do not conform to tosculi society. Renegades must flee or be killed. These outcasts enter a world where they are reviled, where they learn what it means to be alone, but their lives and destinies are theirs to choose. Physical Description The tosculi are hard-shelled creatures that resemble 4-foot-tall, vaguely humanoid wasps with drooping, vestigial wings, small but vicious claws, and compound eyes. Their carapaces tend to be grayish or a dull brown, although a rare few have outer shells with a green, blue, purple, or rainbow-colored reflective sheen. The most distinctive physical trait of the tosculi is the buzzing noise they can suppress or intensify on a whim. An Alien Mind Tosculi minds are alien, especially those still linked to the shared consciousness of the hive. They possess the same emotions other races do, but their thought patterns are often strange or incomprehensible to non-tosculi. Sometimes their actions make sense; at other times, they seem to act without reason. Hiveless living among other races struggle to adapt to their mindsets. The absence of a hive-queen’s voice is an ever-present void in their minds. Society Tosculi who break from their kin remain standoffish toward others. They don’t trust easily and rarely form lasting bonds. They struggle to understand social concepts and the social rules of other races. Some hiveless view relationships as replaceable and only form alliances that advance their goals. Most, though, bond with true friends and companions as if replacing their lost hive. A rare few hiveless tosculi revel in their individuality and constantly seek to make themselves stand out to others. In general, most tosculi value teamwork and strong leadership. Relations with Other Races Tosculi are not popular among any of the races. Many believe all tosculi, connected to the hive or not, should never be trusted. They react to the insect folk with fear or violence, especially in the areas surrounding the Abandoned Lands. Others are more willing to ally with tosculi, including gnolls and trollkin, who themselves are often scorned. Alignment and Religion Hiveless tosculi are often practical, and the hatred they face makes it difficult for them to develop altruism toward others. Therefore, many are neutral. There are as many good tosculi adventurers as evil ones. They tend to consider how their actions affect their own lot more than how they affect others. The existence of the gods is a strange concept for the tosculi; many view religion as capitulation to strong rulers rather than the adoration of divine beings. Many evil tosculi still worship Arbeyach, but those who turn their backs on the Prince of Swarms favor Aposis, the Hunter, Thoth Hermes, or Xevioso. Adventurers Each tosculi is the product of a hive’s need for a certain type of drone, so the hiveless who break away possess a wide variety of physical and mental capabilities. The strong find their place as fighters or barbarians. Those with quick reflexes make invaluable rogues or rangers. Those with greater mental abilities often become talented clerics and druids. While few tosculi pursue arcane studies, those who do are often quite accomplished. Tosculi Names Tosculi’s voices naturally buzz and whine, and so they favor names with long vowels and hard consonants. The hiveless who seek to integrate sometimes choose regional names. Male Names: Billeeck, Gaarent, Pishuun, and Zzereell. Female Names: Malaatha, Naatea, Renaat, and Tayye. Tosculi (Hiveless) Traits Your tosculi character has several special traits. Ability Score Increase. One of your physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) increases by 2, and one of your mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) increases by 2. You also take a –2 penalty to any one ability score. You may apply this penalty to the same ability score to which you gave a +2 bonus, granting you an overall +2 bonus to any one ability score. Age. Tosculi reach maturity at around 13 years but have shorter lifespans than most races with few living longer than 40 years. Alignment. The tension between tosculi and other humanoids often makes it difficult for the Hiveless to develop any true sense of altruism toward others, and many are neutral in alignment, with good tosculi being rare, and evil ones more common. Hiveless tosculi are equally likely to be chaotic, lawful, or neutral. Size. Hiveless tosculi are no more than 4 feet tall and typically weigh less than a humanoid of the same size. Your size is Small. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Natural Armor. Your Armor Class cannot be less than 11 + your Dexterity modifier no matter what armor you are wearing. Natural Attacks. You have proficiency with your claws, which deal 1d4 slashing damage. Gliding Wings. You take no damage from falls. You gain a fly speed of 40 feet but cannot hover. At the end of any round you fly, you must have descended at least one-quarter the distance you traveled or you fall. Stalker. You have proficiency in the Perception skill and Stealth skill. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Tosculi and one other language of your choice (typically Southern). Alternate Racial Traits Binding Spittle. As an Attack action, you may spit a ball of viscous fluid at a target within 60 feet that is Medium or smaller. Make a ranged attack against the target with proficiency. If successful, the fluid hardens upon impact and the target becomes restrained. As an action, the target can make a Strength check against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier to remove the condition. Anyone adjacent to a creature restrained by binding spittle may use their action to free the target in the same way. Dealing an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to half your level plus your Constitution modifier (AC 10) to the spittle also frees the target. After you use binding spittle, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. This trait replaces the Stalker trait. Bite. Some hiveless tosculi develop the fierce mandibles associated with the warriors that defend their hives. You can make a bite attack as an unarmed strike that deals 1d6 slashing damage. On a successful hit with a bite, you may attempt to grapple the target as a bonus action. At 11th level, your bite damage increases to 2d6. This trait replaces the Stalker trait. Latent Hive Mind. You know the message cantrip. This cantrip is a psionic ability that does not require components. The cantrip also functions in a silence spell. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the detect thoughts spell without the need for components. After you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. This trait replaces the Gliding Wings trait. Hardened Carapace. Some hiveless tosculi develop additional defenses at the cost of offensive ability. Your Armor Class cannot be less than 11 + your Constitution modifier + your Dexterity modifier no matter what armor you are wearing. This trait replaces the Gliding Wings and Natural Armor traits.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Southlands Player's Guide"},{"name":"Triton","description":"Ah, the tritons. Imagine if the elves spent a few centuries far beneath the sea, where their arrogance and pretension could grow undisturbed. At least the tritons spent that time fighting sahuagin and worse, so you know you can count on them in a fight. —Brego Stoneheart, sea captain Tritons guard the ocean depths, building small settlements beside deep trenches, portals to the elemental planes, and other dangerous spots far from the eyes of land-bound folk. Long-established guardians of the deep ocean floor, in recent years the noble tritons have become increasingly active in the world above. Aquatic Crusaders Centuries ago, tritons entered the world in response to the growing threat of evil elementals. Tritons waged many wars against their enemies on the Plane of Water, driving them into the Darkened Depths where they escaped into the crushing pressure and utter darkness. In time, the tritons noticed that their ancient elemental foes had grown quiet. Expeditions to the depths revealed that krakens, sahuagin, and far worse foes had fled the Plane of Water for the Material Plane. The tritons, driven by a sense of duty and responsibility, would not allow their foes to escape so easily. A great conclave of tritons chose volunteers skilled in weapons and magic as part of an expeditionary force to enter the Material Plane and seek out their enemies. Those tritons spread across the world’s oceans and established protectorates to watch over deep sea trenches, portals, undersea caves, and other locations where their enemies might lurk. They defeated their foes when they found them and drove the rest into hiding. With their foes banished to the deepest reaches of the sea, tritons settled in to watch for any sign of their return. Over time, the tritons extended their stewardship over the sea floor from their initial settlements and built outposts to create trade with other races. Despite this expansion, few folk know of them. Their settlements are so remote even merfolk and sea elves rarely encounter them. Haughty Nobles As a result of their isolation and limited understanding of the Material Plane, tritons can come across as haughty and arrogant. They see themselves as caretakers of the sea, and they expect other creatures to pay them deep respect, if not complete deference. This attitude might grate on others, but it arises from a seed of truth. Few know of the tritons’ great victories over dreadful undersea threats. The tritons make little allowance for such ignorance and are delighted to expound upon the great debt others owe them. Tritons also have a tendency to emerge from their isolation under the assumption that other folk will welcome them as respected allies and mentors. Again, distance drives much of this attitude. The tritons’ limited view of the world leaves them ignorant of the kingdoms, wars, and other struggles of the surface world. Tritons readily see such concerns as minor events, a sideshow to the tritons’ role as the world’s true protectors. Staunch Champions Despite their off-putting manners, tritons are benevolent creatures at heart, convinced that other civilized races deserve their protection. Their attitude might grate, but when pirate fleets prowl the waves or a kraken awakens from its slumber, they are among the first to take up arms to protect others. Tritons readily sacrifice themselves for the common good. They will fight and die for humans, merfolk, and other creatures without question. Their self-absorbed nature makes them overlook the history of other creatures, but they also endure a sense of guilt over allowing the evils of the Plane of Water to enter the Material Plane and threaten its inhabitants. The tritons believe they owe a debt of honor to the world, and they will fight and die to pay it. At times their fervor and ignorance of the world can lead them astray. Tritons encountering other creatures for the first time can underestimate them, leaving the tritons vulnerable to deception. With their strong martial tradition, tritons can sometimes be too eager to leap into a fight. Strangers to the Surface Given their isolation, most tritons have never been to the surface world. They struggle with the idea that they can’t easily move up and down out of water, and the changing of the seasons mystifies them. Tritons also find the variety of social institutions, kingdoms, and other customs bewildering. For all their proud culture, they remain innocent of the surface world. The typical triton protectorate is tightly regimented, organized, and unified around a common cause. A triton on the surface becomes easily confused by the bewildering array of alliances, rivalries, and petty grievances that prevent the surface folk from truly unifying. At its worst, a triton’s arrogance compounds the tendency for the triton not to understand the ways of the surface world. It’s easy for a triton to blame baffling social practices on what the triton perceives as the barbarism, weakness, or cowardice of surface folk. Triton Personality Far from flawless, these champions of good mean well, but they are easily frustrated by others. You can select, roll, or adapt a triton-specific quirk from the Triton Quirks table. Use the quirk to inform how you portray your character. Triton Quirks d6 Quirk 1 You phrase requests as orders that you expect to be obeyed. 2 You are quick to boast of the greatness of your civilization. 3 You learned an antiquated version of Common and drop “thee” and “thou” into your speech. 4 You assume that people are telling you the truth about local customs and expectations. 5 The surface world is a wondrous place, and you catalog all its details in a journal. 6 You mistakenly assume that surface folk know about and are impressed by your people’s history. Triton Names Most triton names have two or three syllables. Male names typically end with a vowel and the letter s, and female names traditionally end with an n. Tritons use their home protectorate as a surname, with the name formed by adding a vowel followed by a “th” to the end of the protectorate’s name. Female Triton Names: Aryn, Belthyn, Duthyn, Feloren, Otanyn, Shalryn, Vlaryn, Wolyn Male Triton Names: Corus, Delnis, Jhimas, Keros, Molos, Nalos, Vodos, Zunis Triton Surnames: Ahlorsath, Pumanath, Vuuvaxath Triton Traits Your triton character has the following racial traits.

While most live their entire lives beneath the sea, they're not bound to the deep. Following their inherent curiosity, some tritons venture beyond the waves, seeking to explore a whole world of wonders beyond their own. Born of the Sea Tritons are an amphibious people, at home in the water but mobile on dry land. Their bodies are covered in fine scales that range from yellowish-green through shades of blue to deep purple. Their heads are crowned with prominent crests, and fins sprout from their forearms, calves, and shoulders. Their digits are webbed, allowing them to swim as quickly as they can run. Well suited to life in the deep, tritons wear little clothing unless armored for battle. They fashion most of their clothes and other items from materials found in the ocean: coral, seaweed, shells, bone, sea urchin spines, the shells of monstrous crustaceans, and so on. Having an old, well-developed civilization, tritons know much of how to refine these materials into garb as rich and weapons as sturdy as any found on land. Land and Sea For centuries, dryfolk have fished the seas of Theros and have used the sea's surface as a means of travel. Many tritons interpret this as an intrusion into their domains. As a result, some warlike triton communities respond with periodic strikes against sailors and fishing vessels. Others believe that turnabout is fair play and so venture onto land to hunt for meat, steal supplies from coastal travelers, or raid dryfolk poleis for riches. Despite the tensions between tritons and the peoples of the surface, some tritons make their lives on land. Enchanted by the feeling of the winds, the rustle of leaves, the ingenuity of land-dwelling inventors, or any of countless other surface-world charms, every triton living beyond the waves does so for their own reasons. In some places, like the polis of Meletis, whole triton communities flourish among dryfolk neighbors. See chapter 3 for more details on the tritons of Meletis and the Siren Sea. Hand of Thassa While tritons pay respects to many gods, they tend to revere Thassa, god of the sea, above all other deities. Her devotees see her as the primary god of the pantheon, believing she will bring their people to ascendancy over the monsters of the sea and the poleis of the land. Depths of Curiosity Many tritons are intrigued by surface culture. The curious among them venture into sunken ruins and shipwrecks, sifting through the debris for whatever grabs their attention. Often these tritons develop collections of a specific kind of object or lore, trading with one another as they develop a sort of expertise in their field. Some tritons approach investigations of the dryfolk with scientific rigor. Such scholars often hold theories to go along with their collections, hypotheses many are eager to test upon meeting new dryfolk. Triton Names A triton's name is a symbol of choice. Upon reaching adulthood, a triton might shed the name they were given by their parents for one of their own choosing. Some opt to keep their name, but the majority select one that represents the adult they've become. Tritons might even go on to choose yet other names, as they shift from one phase of life to another, or after significant life events. Leaving a home community or transitioning to live among dryfolk might constitute such life changes. Tritons also have a fluid concept of gender and might switch names freely as they shift gender identities. Female Names: Amathe, Gnorcys, Leurybia, Margomestra, Nereones, Oleia, Samathe, Saphiro, Tethene, Theaneia, Thectra Male Names: Bysseus, Cetos, Galaukus, Galiton, Kenessos, Odexes, Palamon, Pontreus, Rheteus, Thrasios Triton Traits Your triton character has the following racial traits.

Among themselves, trollkin refer to each other by identifying marks, well-known deeds, or recognizable characteristics (Bent-nose, Long-claws, Fears-lightning). These labels change depending on what the trollkin has done recently and who’s doing the talking. As long as other trollkin recognize who is being referred to, that’s all that matters. It’s common to string several labels together to get an identifying label (Long-claws-fears-lightning). When they take a “human” name (meaning, for the benefit of humans), it tends to follow the same pattern. Somewhat confusingly, these names also tend to change every time a trollkin introduces itself, since many won’t be bothered to remember what other people called them last week, or yesterday. Names: Broken-fang, Six-fingers, Eye-wart, Hates-birds, Burned-her-cousin, Always-angry, Kicks-children, Sniffs-a-lot, Bites-ears Trollkin Traits Your trollkin character has certain characteristics in common with all other trollkin.

The implication being that somehow, someway, they have the blood of the Yoten flowing through them. A laughable insult, such is, for living where I do, for as long as I have, I’d know if creatures such as these walked among us. They don’t exist. Our ancestors left all that behind them when they came here, to Grimnir. I am sure of it.\" —Zelan, owner of the Eye of the Storm Tuss do in fact exist. Their mothers are always human and when they are born the tuss are indistinguishable from other babies. The only difference that becomes apparent as they age is that they are generally stronger, healthier, and more successful than their cohorts. Many tuss even live their entire lives without ever realizing how different they are. Others are not so lucky. It might happen in a fight or a harsh argument. Their eyes flash purple. They land a blow too hard. The blood flowing in their veins transforms them, providing a glimpse into their ancestry. As quickly as it comes this transformation ends. Often the event goes without any remark from friends or family. They ignore it, pretend it never happened. They don’t want it to have happened. But sometimes the event cannot be pretended away and the tuss must be dealt with. They may be ushered out of their community by cover of night—exiled. Other times they are killed. This is done simply because the tuss is feared to be a Yoten. All of this is done to protect their families. For if knowledge of the tuss ever becomes widely known anyone close to them is at risk. Secret Birthright When a tuss comes of age a drive kindles in them. They become obsessed with bettering themselves—some do it by mastering their abilities on the battlefield while others seek out knowledge, desiring to learn all that they can. But most lack an understanding of their true nature… and many do not even try to understand why they are so different. Because they fear any answers they might find. Capable and Remarkable The tuss love their communities and learn to do all they can to better them. Others come to rely upon the tuss so they often become raid leaders, even jarls. The future is bright for a raider tuss—as long as they never reveal their true ancestry. Tuss Names Tuss have the same names as others in their community. Tuss Traits Tuss have the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Age. Tuss age the same as humans. Size. You are Medium. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet. Steadfast. As long as you have not taken lightning damage since your last turn, if you are reduced to zero hit points, or as a bonus action on your turn, you may spend one Hit Die to regain hit points. Roll your die and add your Constitution modifier. You are healed by this amount. You are unable to use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest. True Nature. As an action, you manifest your true nature. Your physical appearance changes noticeably. Your skin or eyes may shift to an unusual color. You might sprout horns or suddenly become covered with fur or scales. Define these appearance details when you select this race. You may use an action to hide your true nature once more. While your true nature ability is active you have the following additional abilities: Darkvision. You see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light (colors in this darkness are seen as shades of gray). Powerful. Whenever you hit with a weapon attack you do additional damage, equal to half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up). Swift. Your walking speed increases by 5. Unsettling.

These umbral folk are not merely humans corrupted by shadow but rather slowly transformed by their exposure to shadow over generations, gradually becoming inured to it. These are the changelings. Beyond shadow's natural and inevitable influence, the shadow fey have long experimented with the shadows and its effects on mortals, whether to punish the foolish or to create better servants—or just for fun—and some umbral humans, those that survive, are the result of these rituals.

As the populations of races grow in the various kingdoms of shadow, so the network of gateways feeding into their shadow roads also grows. None are more aware of this than the unbound satarre, a small faction zealously dedicated to unraveling barriers between the worlds. The unbound satarre are a curiosity even among their own kind since they have an instinctual sensitivity to places of transition. An unbound satarre is compelled to find such gateways and widen their influence through mundane or magical means. Unbound satarre are a subrace of satarre. You can find more about the base satarre race in Tome of Heroes . Unbound Satarre Names Like other satarre, unbound satarre names often resemble names of the cultures where they are raised, though satarre raised on the planes or in cults of darkness or death tend toward names common to those planes or that invoke the cult's tenets. Names in Void Speech are also common and are presented below. All satarre are given cult names, indicating which dark god their lives were dedicated to at their naming day. Such names preface the name of the cult or god with ai- and sometimes shorten the cult or god's name to two or three syllables. Most continue to serve or at least pray to these gods as adults, with varying degrees of piety. Example Male Names: Aggorret (eater), Denahrek (servant), Medloss (binder), Mörkothr (darkness), Narkot (gnawer), Pälsore (slaver), Vessar (blooddrinker), Rabefress (slayer). Example Female Names: Atlessa (jewel), Binulett (scout), Frizel (scribe), Ixa (blade), Miskra (maggot), Respy (builder), Unskappa (wisdom), Unterra (doom). Unbound Satarre Traits You are a satarre with a tendency for plane-hopping that sets you apart from most other satarre. You exhibit a few different traits from typical satarre. The following traits include those shared with the base satarre's traits (see Tome of Heroes ), though replacing the Ability Score Increase, A Friend to Death, and Carrier of Rot traits with those listed. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. (This trait replaces the base satarre's Ability Score Increase trait.) Age. Satarre grow quickly, walking soon after hatching and reaching the development of a 15-year-old human by age 6. They maintain the same appearance until about 50 and then begin a rapid decline. Satarre often die violently, but those who live longer survive to no more than 65 years of age. Alignment. Satarre are born with a tendency toward evil akin to that of rapacious dragons, and when raised among other satarre or darakhul, they are usually evil. Those raised among other cultures tend toward the norm for those cultures. Size. Satarre are tall and thin, from 6 to 7 feet tall with peculiar, segmented limbs. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to your dark planar parentage, you have superior vision in darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keeper of Secrets. You have proficiency in the Arcana skill, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to the planes and planar travel. In addition, you have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, or Religion. Portal Sense. While in a confined space, you instinctively know the direction and distance to the closest nonmagical entrance or exit to the area you are currently in. You also have advantage on any Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) ability checks made to find secret or invisible doors and magical portals. (This trait replaces the base satarre's A Friend of Death trait.) Unraveling Touch. You can use your action to attempt to tear at the reality that keeps a being together. Choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature that fails the saving throw must use its action each turn to repeat the saving throw as it attempts to keep itself in one piece. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest. (This trait replaces the base satarre's Carrier of Rot trait.) Languages. You can speak, read, and write Umbral and either Abyssal, Infernal, or Void Speech.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Book of Ebon Tides Compendium"},{"name":"Unique Existence","description":"You might be a lost royal from a lunar kingdom, washed upon the shore after falling from a moon-ship as it crossed the sky. You could be the spirit of an ancient mountain, walking the land clad in mortal flesh to see it through human eyes. Or you might be a painting so achingly beautiful you stepped from the canvas as your creator finished your last stroke. Whatever you are, nobody in Rokugan has seen anything else like you, at least not for a very long time. One of a Kind This is a species that plays up the mythic themes of Adventures in Rokugan : a being not easily defined or categorized, or one so rare in Rokugan as to be effectively unique. It is excellent for creating characters who evoke mythological characters. Celestial dragons traveling in mortal guise, lost siblings of the founders of Rokugan, and beings of other realms not reflected earlier in this chapter can all be created this way. The GM is the final arbiter if a concept is viable for a particular campaign. Distinguishing Features Though your body appears mortal enough to most onlookers (human, or another species of your choice with the GM’s permission), you might have unusual visual traits that mark you as somewhat otherworldly. Your eyes might be unusually bright or your voice exceptionally sonorous. Perhaps you have a strange scar or birthmark that catches people’s attention. To the spiritually attentive, your supernatural air is noticeable. Unique Existence Traits As something truly unique, you benefit from the following: Ability Score Increase . Choose one ability score to increase by 2, and another to increase by 1. Age . You could have existed only for mere moments or be as ancient as time itself. Discuss this with your GM. Size . Your size is that of the species you choose. Speed . Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Being of Myth . When it comes to a particular art or skill, you do not just excel at it—you embody it without effort. Choose one skill. You gain proficiency in this skill.

Through effort, you can surpass normal mortal limits in your abilities. At 7th level or higher, the ability score associated with the skill you chose for your Being of Myth feature can increase above the normal limit of 20, to a maximum of 22. You must still use an Ability Score Increase or other means of raising your ability score to accomplish this increase. Unmistakable Presence .

It is akin to an awakening of the soul, an inner voice that calls out in your mind, drowning out the myriad of distractions that swirl around us. And when that voice calls, embrace it. Wield it. Let it tear out of you and become yourself anew. Only then, will you know who and what you truly are.” — Neivie Banetail, Valna elder Most spacefaring races are able to incorporate the advancements and practices of interstellar neighbors into their own culture and lifestyle. The valna are afforded no such mindset. They are beasts, first and foremost, with more connection to the creatures of the wild than they would ever have with a human. Technology has become a forced necessity, used at first to stop the threat of genocide. However, their elders take great care to not let these unnatural advancements overtake their habitat and way of life. Despite these resentments toward technology, many valna have accepted that they are now part of a much larger galaxy. They therefore make efforts to create alliances and friendships in an attempt to learn from those around them, as well as help these newfound allies to understand and accept the valna’s unfamiliar practices. Feral Duality The valna bear both catlike and humanoid traits, though it’s their bestial nature that can dictate how they think and deal with others. They act primarily on instinct, seeing emotions such as fear, delight, and anxiety as tools toward survival versus something meant to be understood or defined. Whenever a valna shows anger or acts with aggression, it is often coupled with a tangible reason such as survival, hunger, or surpassing an obstacle that keeps them from going forward. It doesn’t mean they lack emotion. They are, in fact, very empathetic. But they will likely choose to not express them in the moment if a more fundamental necessity takes precedence. They also have a knack of being able to read the emotions of those around them, often reacting accordingly. This way of thinking can make valna companions very hard to read in certain situations. People who are joyous or who make the valna feel at ease find a much easier time dealing with them. Physically, most valna possess a lean build. The majority of their features are catlike but they stand upright on their inverted hind legs. Their body fur can be shades of black, brown, gray, orange, or white. Some have a combination of colors in the form of stripes or spots. Their eyes can be brown, blue, green, hazel, or yellow. The Tribe and the Pack There were once many different tribes that lived on Vaal. The bio-weapon that tore through their people wiped out generations of valna, leading to consolidation of the scattered groups. There are only a few surviving tribes of valna. Where a valna’s tribe determines their bloodline, their pack defines their role in society. A valna’s pack and their role within it is the most important aspect of their being. Their deeds and actions within a pack denotes their position in the valna society, as well as how they are viewed amongst their peers. A valna without a pack is deemed to be unworthy of respect. On Vaal, packs are easily formed. However, it is much different for valna who travel across the stars. These travelers often find themselves adopting their alien companions as packmates, often choosing their own role or working with their teammates in order to define one. Strive to Survive Survival and preservation of their pack takes precedence above all else, often causing valna to take actions that others might see as harsh or cold-hearted. This is mostly attributed to their upbringing within the unforgiving environment of their homeworld, where many other savage beasts dwell. Such mannerisms show themselves less for valna who have spent years away from Vaal, but it is and always will be a part of their inherent nature. Valna Names Valna have a given name at birth they keep throughout their lifetime. Once they reach adulthood, they must go through a rite of passage, usually one that requires a test of cunning and survival. It is usually during this ritual the valna receives their surname, which is traditionally a marker of an important event in their life, a deed performed, or a particular aspect of their persona.

Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You have keen, catlike senses. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were in dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Claws. Your sharp claws grant you a climbing speed of 20 feet while wearing anything other than heavy armor. In addition, your claws are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Catlike Agility.

Throughout the afternoon, evening, and night, he has meticulously inspected his tools, a wide array of mallets, sledges, and, of course, hammers, cleaning them, performing repairs, and organizing them by size and by color, only powering down for a few hours in the middle of the night. Through the walls of his workshop, Hammerer can see the heat signatures of people waking up and preparing breakfast; he performs a similar ritual, polishing his chassis and running diagnostics for the day ahead. Mentally, he has a checklist of duties and chores before he begins the day’s work. Finally, the clocks strike seven, and Hammerer leaves his home, a room barely ten feet square, and heads out into the town. Somewhere in the market, a child cries for his mother to buy him a toy, and Hammerer puzzles at this behavior; work, after all, is far more interesting than frivolity. — A typical morning for Hammerer, a vect craftsman Living constructs designed by dwarves as laborers, the vect are now free to search the ‘verse for meaning. Evolved Golems The vect were preceded by unthinking golems of various designs; unlike their predecessors, however, the vect are fully living beings. Underneath their armored exteriors lies an organically-influenced anatomy, with a circulatory system and a network of magical nerves. At the heart of each vect unit is an everlasting construct core, tinged with the influence of the Spark that awoke them. Vect bodies are humanoid in shape, but unmistakably mechanical, with large air intakes, protective shoulder plates, toothless jaws, and glowing mechanical eyes. Though each of the Foundries which create them produce vect in slightly different proportions, the general shape is always the same and vect parts are always compatible. In fact, many vect choose to install specially-designed components to improve their bodies, up to and including replacing limbs with appropriate tools. When a vect readies for a dangerous journey, their preparation will likely include purchasing construct grafts as replacement parts. Vect can work tirelessly and never need to sleep, instead entering a dreamless period of inactivation each day. Most vect create endless lists of goals and chores, allowing the monotonous sequence of tasks to break up the march of days, weeks, and months. It is not uncommon to see a vect standing watch over their party, sharpening tools and repairing armor while the others sleep. Mechanical Minds Although vect units experience the same fear, anger, pain, loss, and other emotions that humanoids do, their expression of them is muted. A vect’s mechanical face and harsh, metallic voice does little to endear it to others, driving a wedge between vect and most other living things. Many vect, therefore, seek refuge in logical thinking. Some become emotionally distant and lack introspection, whereas others plumb the philosophies of existence and consider what it means to be alive. These become the two extremes, between vect who seek to embrace their status as living things, and those who wish to banish all within themselves that is not construct. The vast majority of vect exist between these extremes. Vect are most comfortable existing within a small group of some kind, as long as it is dedicated to a purpose. Temples, adventuring parties, and voyages of exploration are deeply attractive to the vect. Search for Meaning All vect are keenly aware that they were once nonliving material which suddenly became a fully-formed living thing. And while there is no doubt that vect are alive, the destination of their souls upon death is another matter entirely. The philosophical implications of this aren't lost on them, and the questions of existence echo loudly inside some vect. Though the Foundries which build them are intelligent beyond measure, they are wordless in their duties, and ascribe no grand meaning to their creations. Some vect find comfort in faith, generally worshiping gods of arcana, smiths, and constructs. Others seek permanent distraction in quests and chores. Others still look to the 'verse for answers and hope to find meaning among understanding. Vect Names The original vect were divided into working groups and given numbers by their dwarven keepers; nothing more was necessary. Now, however, all vect choose their own names, usually designations reflecting some function or purpose, though some vect choose to be identified by their serial number, or a nickname given to them by others. Vect Names. 176, Armory, Bolts, Clunk, Crusher, Glitch, Hammerer, Keeper, Lifter, Null, Phong, Scarce, ThreeFour-Three, Titan, Unit Seventeen, Watcher Vect Traits Your mechanical body is driven by an inexhaustible construct core, and has the following traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Reconfigurable Ability Score Increase. One ability score of your choice increases by 1, and you can change this selection whenever you finish a long rest. You can't increase Constitution using this trait and you can't increase any ability score above 20. Age. With the proper replacement parts and activities to occupy yourself, you can conceivably exist indefinitely. Vect are known to degrade and lose their sanity, however, if they live too long without an explicit purpose. It isn't known if this insanity visits all vect at old ages, or just those whose resolve wavers. Alignment. Vect possess mechanical minds, which find logic comforting. Generally, vect are lawful. Size. As constructs built by massive forges, the vect could conceivably be perfectly uniform, like the golems that preceded them. However, the Foundries are either inherently flawed, or otherwise have a fondness for making diverse vect units, for each created vect is in some way unique. Vect units stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and average about 150 to 300 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Thermalsight. You gain thermalsight, which mean s you can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one-inch of any solid barrier. Construct Anatomy. Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to nonmagical diseases. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. You have advantage on saving throws you make against exhaustion. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You don't dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal. You can still be placed into a torpor by sleep-inducing magic. Inflexible Mind. Your mechanical mind is inherently logical and not easily swayed. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed. Embedded Armor. You can install special armor plating directly onto your body. This embedded armor counts as a construct graft installed in the External slot. The rules of construct grafts are explained in the Equipment chapter of Dark Matter. At 1st level, you choose one of the following types of embedded armor, though you can install other types if you acquire them in the world. Velocity Plating. Your movement speed increases by 5 feet and your long jump distance increases by 5 feet. Composite Plating. Your Armor Class equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Juggernaut Plating. Your Armor Class equals 16. You can't wear conventional armor while you have this graft installed. You can only install this graft if you are proficient with heavy armor. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Mage Hand Press","book":"Dark Matter Starter Kit"},{"name":"Vedalken","description":"Nothing is perfect. Vedalken not only believe this fact, they rejoice in it. Every imperfection is a chance for improvement, and progress is an endless march toward a state of perfection that can never be reached. This viewpoint leads vedalken to pursue their work with delighted enthusiasm, never deterred by setbacks and excited by every opportunity for improvement. Vedalken are tall and slender, standing almost a head taller than humans on average but weighing about the same. Their hairless skin comes in a range of shades of blue. Their eyes are darker shades of blue or violet. They lack external ears, their noses are broad and flat, and they are partially amphibious. Cool Rationality Despite being talkative, vedalken keep their personal lives private, and they tend to engage more with ideas than with people. They form close friendships based on mutual interests or compelling disagreements, and their interactions dwell on their thoughts about those issues rather than their feelings about them. To members of other races, vedalken often seem cold, even emotionless. That assessment isn’t fair—they feel emotion every bit as intensely as other folk do, but they are skilled at not displaying it. Cool rationality guides their actions, they make and follow careful plans, and they are patient enough to do nothing when the ideal outcome relies on such inaction. Reasoning toward Perfection Their curious intellects and rational minds incline vedalken toward membership in the Azorius Senate , the Simic Combine , and (less often) the Izzet League . Whatever their guild affiliation, they put their intelligence to use in crafting and improving things, whether those things are laws, procedures, or magical sciences. Vedalken believe that the path toward the impossible goal of perfection is paved with bricks of education, careful deliberation, and controlled experimentation. Some vedalken direct their energy toward perfecting themselves, whether by means of Simic bioengineering or through extensive study, and others concentrate on perfecting society through the careful drafting and application of laws. Vedalken Names Vedalken are given names at birth, but usually choose new names for themselves as part of their transition into adulthood. They rarely use family names.

That-Which-Endures held entropy back for a mere instant, and the Verdan emerged. I’m sorry, was that the question? —K’thriss Drow’b The verdan owe their existence to chaos. Descended and transformed from a large clan of goblins and hobgoblins, those who became the verdan were simply living their lives, doing goblinoid things. But then passing through the shadow of That-Which-Endures changed them forever. Now the newest race to call Faerûn home, the verdan do their best to find their way in an unfamiliar world. Created by Chaos When the power of That-Which-Endures mutated the verdan, their skin was turned the color of jade and their blood began to flow black. Their ears grew pointed, and they gained a limited form of telepathy—but at the cost of forgetting their history. The underground homes of the goblins were places of terror to the new creatures those goblins became, and the verdan quickly fled to the surface and into the sunlight. When they arrived in the new lands of the surface, the verdan found that they were often mistaken for smaller, green-skinned half-elves. Attracting curiosity but no real questions, they have thus been able to make their way reasonably freely in the world. That-Which-Endures That-Which-Endures is a nameless, faceless, mysterious entity, something between a multiverse-spanning primordial spirit and an over-god. It represents the amoral and all-encompassing power of entropy—the force that unknowingly and uncaringly changes order into chaos, and that breaks matter and time down into its component parts so that all can be rebuilt. Some who study this entity claim that it is clearly evil and destructive. Others call it simply a necessary part of the cycle of death and rebirth. In the end, though, That-Which-Endures shows precious little interest in what people say about it. Ongoing Mutations Because the verdan have not dwelled long in the world, they are still discovering new things about themselves. Chief among these discoveries is that their physical forms change as they age, signifying that the mutative power of That-Which-Endures is not done with them. The first verdan emerged from the Underdark as creatures of goblin stature. But they soon learned that their kind were fated to eventually undergo a dramatic, painful, and random growth spurt that sees them transformed to hobgoblin size over a period of days. At the same time, many verdan undergo changes in coloring as they age. Male verdan typically have little to no hair, while females sport shocks of wiry hair that they try to tame in a variety of styles. But the color of any verdan’s hair, skin, and eyes can transform from their original jade tones to pale white, deep ebon, or any other shade in between. A verdan’s ears also undergo numerous spontaneous alterations over their lifetime, from the typical range of point and peak seen among the elves, to huge ears that sweep back from the head like wings, and which are often pierced behind the head with a single ring to keep them from flapping about. Changes in gender are also a known and accepted part of verdan life. These fluid aspects of form and identity are seen as blessings, allowing an individual to experience more of the world and grow in empathy and understanding. There is no pattern to any verdan’s mutations, as verdan from the same family can shift in drastically different ways. The verdan assign no cultural or biological relevance to any particular coloration, physical features, or gender. Cultural Chameleons The clan homes of the Underdark goblinoids who became the verdan covered an enormous area. As the verdan fled to the surface world, they emerged in culturally diverse locations. Some found themselves near dwarven strongholds, others near elven enclaves, and others near the widespread human settlements of Faerûn. Without a cultural identity or memory of their own, the verdan quickly adopted the cultural practices of the areas into which they migrated. Still, a sense of not truly belonging is felt even by verdan who have been welcomed into other cultures. They are often stricken with wanderlust, keeping their possessions limited and easily portable. It is not unusual to see individual verdan or whole families trooping along the roads of the world with their tents and belongings strapped to their backs. Even when they are happily steeped in a culture, the verdan remain on the lookout for oppression and curtailment of freedoms. They understand the need for laws that protect, but they rail against laws that restrict and oppress—especially those designed to protect the power and wealth of the elite. When living among enlightened folk, verdan are still the first to speak out against cultural restraints on individuals, particularly those based on physical characteristics such as gender, race, or appearance. Wide-Eyed and Curious Verdan are hungry to undertake new challenges and absorb new experiences. When they meet other verdan who have traveled to different parts of the world, they drop everything to spend as long as possible sharing stories and observations from their respective travels. However, their inexperience in the world and their racial amnesia sometimes lends the verdan a kind of innocence that works against them. Some are credulous and easily fooled by hucksters, but most verdan have an intuition bred by empathy that helps them eventually sort out those who are sincere from those who are not. Verdan Names The oldest verdan names spring from goblinoid traditions, but more recent names reflect the character of the different cultures these folk have encountered since coming out into the sunlight. When a group of verdan live near dwarves, they might take on more dwarven-sounding names, only to change those names when they wander into a human area. A verdan is also not hesitant to change their name as their physical appearance changes—or, indeed, whenever the mood strikes them. Verdan make no differentiation between male, female, and family names, and often eschew family names altogether. Verdan Names: Bronn, Crahma, Dolar, Dreeda, Duglee, Gruvald, Hulm, Jeal, Kalo, Klesh, Korm, Lathi, Ovlig, Paracii, Pils, Praet, Promul, Reezni, Rin, Shylk, Slyra, Sollo, Stalsii, Stromvo, Stussa, Syrkart, Takat, Toit, Tubyna, Varr, Veriga, Wraq, Wural, Wurxee Verdan Traits Verdan characters have a number of traits in common with others of their kind. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Verdan reach adulthood at around the age of 24, and it is thought that they might live to nearly 200 years old. However, because no verdan has died of old age since the race’s initial creation, their upper age limits remain subject to speculation. Alignment. Verdan are generally good, although their absence of racial identity and shared history can sometimes see individual verdan become untethered from any moral or ethical framework. Size. Verdan start out similar in size to the goblins they were created from, ranging from 3 to 4 feet in height. But at some point after reaching maturity, each verdan undergoes a sudden growth spurt of 2 feet or more. At 1st level, you are a Small creature. When you reach 5th level, you become a Medium creature. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Black Blood Healing. The black blood that is a sign of your people’s connection to That-Which-Endures boosts your natural healing. When you roll a 1 or 2 on any Hit Die you spend at the end of a short rest, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Limited Telepathy. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathy, but it must be able to understand at least one language. This process of communication is slow and limited, allowing you to transmit and receive only simple ideas and straightforward concepts. Persuasive. Your people’s lack of history makes you trustworthy and humble. You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill. Telepathic Insight. Your mind’s connection to the world around you strengthens your will. You have advantage on all Wisdom and Charisma saving throws. Languages. You speak, read, and write Common, Goblin, and one additional language of your choice. This language typically has some connection to one of the areas or cultures that has been part of your life. Underlying Improvements When a verdan character gains an ability score improvement at certain levels, that increase can be tied to a physical mutation at the player’s determination. A boost to Strength might be accompanied by a growth spurt and the development of rippling muscle, while an increase in Intelligence might produce a stylishly large forehead.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":4048},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Acquisitions Incorporated"},{"name":"Vindicator Scions","description":"“‘Judicator.’ That is the word they spit at us. They have snarled spittle at me as I chain them, seething, ‘Blasphemous judge, lightsworn scourge.’ But think on the word—vindicator. To clear someone. Prove them to be right. Advocate for them. We purge darkness and determine the truth, yes, to prove the goodness of mortalkind and champion them into the light.” —Iradeza, vindicator paladin Those with vindicator heritage have the bloodiest charge of all: to exterminate evil. In the eternal war of goodness against corruption, vindicator scions are holy bounty hunters, inquisitives, spies, and bloodhounds for truth and justice. When they receive a target from the Celestials that guide them, they stop at nothing, overturning the world for the sake of purging wickedness. Adorned in Iron A vindicator’s wings extend in metallic blades, from large feathers of bulky claymore blades down to the thinnest rapier spines, some even curving like a cutlass or a saber. No two vindicators share the same wingspan, and unlike the wings of other scions, their wings are almost always present—a declaration of intent. At the height of the vindicator’s fury, these bladewings glow, much like the light-forged chains they summon to ensnare their targets. And when some Celestials would conjure a halo, a vindicator manifests a crown of iron and steel above their head. Their silhouette is an omen—with bladed wings spread wide, a jagged crown of iron hovering above, there can be no doubt that you have incurred heaven’s holy ire. Judge, Jury, Executioner A vindicator scion doesn’t hunt everyday sinners and common criminals. Vindicators seek the most dangerous of targets—those who use magic to avoid capture, those who escape death and rise eternal, and those who have amassed a power like unto divinity. Often, the target’s guilt is obvious when the vindicator arrives. The scion need only act as tracker, captor, and, if necessary, executioner. Vindicators are remarkably discerning. They aren’t dogs, hunting without reason. They are agents for divine justice. If guilt is not determined—if there is even a chance that a target is innocent—then the vindicator must stay their hand. Celestial progenitors form deep relationships with their vindicators, trust them immensely, and listen if doubt forms in the scion’s mind about the target—whether or not they agree with the vindicator’s opinion. Vindicators as Adventurers Like many scions, some vindicators find that adventuring carries out their purpose. They need not be given names to act in the name of truth and justice—enough evil is found merely by taking jobs from mortals, traveling, seeking treasure, and helping others. As long as a vindicator scion roots out evil and purges it, they fulfill their holy calling. However, when their progenitor assigns the vindicator scion a name, that task demands their focus. A vindicator who dawdles knows the radiant ire that awaits them if they fail to answer the call. The Call to Hunt Once or even twice a campaign, giving a vindicator a name to hunt down while the party is entrenched in another important task can create a fantastic tension in the party. Will the group stop what they’re doing to help the vindicator find their quarry? Will the vindicator risk divine retribution to delay the hunt and stay with their allies? Will the party split to accomplish both? What is the punishment if the vindicator delays? However, this is only effective on a rare and tense occasion. When used repeatedly, it becomes frustrating for the table, and the effect is lost. Use sparingly—and if in doubt, consider discussing the possibility of such an arc with the players outside of the game. Vindicator Scions Traits Your vindicator scion has the following traits. Ability Score Increase Your Strength score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Age Vindicator scions mature at the same rate as humans, but they can live up to 150 years. Alignment Vindicator scions tend toward good, neutral, and lawful alignments. As they work closely with Celestials to enact their justice, they value fairness, discipline, boldness, and action. When they begin to justify the means of their justice, that is when evil or chaotic alignments manifest—and that may cause them to be stripped of their holy calling. Light of the Hunter As an action, you target a creature you can see within 60 feet of you, stabbing a golden sliver of light into its soul. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature is marked with a hunter’s beacon for 8 hours. While the creature is marked, you know its location as long as its on the same plane of existence as you. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you. You can only have one target marked in this way at a time. Chains of the Vindicator Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, imbuing yourself with the fires of justice and donning wings of steel blades. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. For the duration, you gain the following benefits: You have a flying speed of 30 feet. As a bonus action, you can summon light-forged chains as a bonus action and hurl them at a creature within 30 feet. That creature must make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the target is restrained until the end of your next turn. Once during each of your turns, you can deal additional radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The additional radiant damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"MCDM Productions","book":"Arcadia Issue No. 11"},{"name":"Vor'tai","description":"The vor’tai behind the counter smiled wide, his long teeth glinting in the dim light of the shop. Barely enough to see by, but the wizard had to give him credit for at least a cursory attempt at making his customers welcome. “Divinerrrrrrrr. Pleased to see you.” Telara looked at Zar’s blindfold and opened her mouth to say something, but thought better of it. “I have what you seek,” he hissed, standing up and lifting the flap on the shop counter. He began to make his way through a beaded doorway into the back room, beckoning the wizard to follow. “We have visitors from your realm so rarely, how was your journey?” he said as he led her into a small room lined with shelves of curios and esoteric tomes. In the centre of the room stood a small round table, a shimmering cloth draped over it and bare, except for a small metal box. “The usual. Gates aren’t exactly taxing on the system. Instantaneous, you know?” Zar gave no reply, retrieving the box from the table before turning to face her. “Now, a word of warning…” — “The Diviner” Though the mortal lands are walked by all manner of different species, it was not always so. In eons past, mortality was the sole purview of the astrals, who built a vast and magnificent civilization among the Starscape. The astrals grew to command the forces of creation and life itself and when their civilization was thrust into the fires of war, they created the vor to serve them. While the blue vor’sular served as custodians of the astrals’ knowledge, the red vor’tai were crafted as great warriors and guardsmen, serving their astral masters faithfully until they vanished into history. Released from servitude, the vor now dwell within the Starscape, carving out pockets of civilization in that midnight sea. Physiology Vor’tai are tall and lanky, ranging between six and eight feet tall when fully grown, and with deep red skin. Vor’tai have an additional thumb on each hand to create broadly symmetrical hands, and wear blindfolds or veils over their eyes. There are no records from anyone that has seen underneath one of these veils, although it's reasonable to assume they must be veiling...something! Every now and then someone gets an idea to find out, but they invariably...don't come back. The first vor’tai are said to have worn these blindfolds to shield themselves from beholding the true horrors of their masters’ enemies, but in the ages since the Astral War their use has primarily become for focusing their psychic abilities. Astral Servants A people designed in exacting detail to serve as soldiers and guardsmen, the vor’tai were once instrumental in the expansion of the astrals’ empire, and in its defence during the Astral War. Beset on all sides by those that would tear down the astrals’ golden towers, vor’tai were dispatched in vast legions throughout the Starscape in a conflict that lasted millenia, and which ultimately saw the astrals defeated and the vor freed from their bonds of servitude. Though the true nature of the astrals’ enemies are believed lost to history, the ramifications of the great war can yet be seen in shattered vessels and ruined structures that now drift through the Starscape, many of which have been reclaimed by the vor and transformed into bustling cities, merchant outposts, and vessels of war. A Psychic View Whether by virtue of the astrals’ design or the influence of millennia spent within the Starscape, vor minds are honed to a keen psychic edge, and their psionic abilities underpin all aspects of vor life, most notably how they perceive the world around them. Vor do not view the world with their own eyes, but rather through the eyes of others. Where other sapient species see the world through light and its reflection, vor see that same world through the psychic ripples created by others’ comprehension of their surroundings. Citizens of the Stars Though the astrals are now little more than a footnote in cosmic history, of relevance only to scholars and historians, the vor persist. Released from their bonds of servitude they live now within the Starscape, carving out lives at all levels of civilization. Some crew starsails as merchants, smugglers, or pirates, others live simple lives in vor communes, and many yet live as citizens of Aeon, the City Among the Stars, undertaking any number of professions its people might require. Despite being freed from their astral masters, vor’tai often still feel an ancestral pull towards the martial pursuits they were crafted for and regularly serve as cosmic mercenaries, warrior-monks, or even assassins – within the Starscape or abroad. Thanks to both this inherited aptitude for warcraft and their psychic skills, a vor’tai warrior is a fearful sight for those they would do harm… Vor'tai Names Most vor’tai names are composed of between one and three syllables, separated by glottal stops. Vor’tai Names: Am’aan, Ban’a’dar, Dai’mun, Kam’sin’ra, Mar’dir, Ro’kan, Tor’ma’kai, Vai, Ven’kal, Zar Vor'tai Traits As a vor’tai, you gain the following traits: Ability Score Increase. Increase one ability score of your choice by 2, and another by 1. You cannot increase scores past 20 in this manner. Age. Vor’tai lifespans are difficult to determine as extraplanar time is rarely measured in years and can often flow differently than the Mortal Realm. Scholars’ best guesses show vor’tai reach adulthood quickly – within about ten years of birth – and can live upwards of five centuries. There are some reports of current-day vor'tai that claim to have served in this 'Astral War' of eld. Nonsense, surely. Perhaps there have been many Astral Wars? Alignment. Vor’tai nowadays come from all sides of the cosmic spectrum, but still carry much of their history as astral servants with them. Vor’tai of all alignments can reasonably be found, but on average they skew more towards the lawful end of the spectrum as a result. Size. Vor’tai stand approximately six to eight feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. You have a base walking speed of 30 feet. Astral Intellect. You can communicate telepathically with a creature within 30 feet of you. You do not need to share a language, but the creature must be capable of understanding at least one language. You have resistance to psychic damage. Mind’s Eye 1 . Vor’tai view the world not through eyes of their own, but through the psychic ripples emanated from other creatures’ perception and understanding. You can see everything creatures within 30 feet of you see but are otherwise blind. A creature aware of you and your sense can block their vision from you on a successful Intelligence saving throw. The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. Psychic Understanding. Your psychic senses allow you to tune into a creature’s empathic currents, granting you proficiency in the Insight skill. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Vor. Vor Texts and the Psychal Script As vor see the world psychically rather than visually, their idea of a physical text is drastically different from other peoples’. Physical text written by vor is written in the psychal script, a form of embossed writing that vor read by running their fingers over it. This psychal script has an additional layer where the author imbues it with feelings, memories, or images during the writing phase, which vor experience while reading it. As a result, much psychal script is disjointed and strange to others, as these two aspects are used in conjunction with one another, and mortals reading longer passages of psychal script usually find the experience to be one where they only have half the story. 1 – If this feels too weird or like too much of a headache to manage at the table, you can alternatively just have 30 feet of blindsight and be blind beyond that range. Or just use normal vision.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":16222},"publisher":"Animancer","book":"Enchiridion Vaz’kin’rai"},{"name":"Vulpin","description":"\"My dearest, though your dangerous and reckless lifestyle worries me so, I know that you will outwit any opponent who comes your way...\" - Love letter excerpt from Tybalt Hillshaw to his bandit lover Vulpins are fox-like in appearance, with light builds and sharp fangs. One of the least understood and most often vilified humblefolk in the Wood, vulpins have earned a bad reputation that isn’t entirely deserved. Much of this stems from the fact that vulpins are ambitious. Sometimes their drive to succeed can make it difficult for them to empathize with others. Vulpins feel just as deeply as other folk of the Wood, but they possess a keen survival instinct which sometimes causes them to take courses of action that are selfish. Moreover, they are sharp and savvy, possessing an uncanny force of personality that allows them to easily sway the trust of others. In the right situations, vulpins can be true friends, and in the wrong ones, deadly enemies. Artful and Cunning Vulpins are naturally intelligent, rivalled only by corvums. However, where corvums are studious, vulpins are more creative. They enjoy the arts and the pursuit of leisure. Some devote their lives to mastering an art form; learning sculpture, poetry, or refined swordplay. Even though vulpins come from every walk of life, they also have a reputation for being snobbish and looking down on others. All vulpins have a natural connection to the magic of the Wood, though they channel it in specialized ways. The right look from a vulpin can bewitch or terrify, and vulpins who are truly skilled can command an entire room through sheer force of presence. Prodigious Predators Before the Humblefolk Treaty was signed, vulpins controlled a large part of the Wood outside the influence of the birdfolk, and bands of vulpin raiders provided their own kin with a wealth of plundered goods at the expense of birdfolk and other humblefolk alike. Those days are long since gone, but the memory of the sinister vulpin has yet to fade from the minds of the humblefolk, who endured great suffering at their hands. A few vulpins have attempted to change public opinion, but the majority are unconcerned with their notoriety. Vulpins learn from a young age that they are of two natures: the sophisticated and the savage. While sophistication and elegance are generally preferred, it is considered common sense that vulpins should know when to keep their fangs hidden and when to bear them. Vulpin Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Age. Vulpins mature at an average pace, and can be comparatively long-lived. They reach adulthood at 15 years, and live well past 90 years. Alignment. Vulpins aren’t innately evil, but their difficulty empathizing with others means they are only rarely good aligned. Most vulpins find strict authority distasteful, preferring chaotic alignments over lawful ones. Size. Vulpins cut dashing figures and are usually lean and muscular. They stand between 4 and a half and 5 and a half feet tall, but are relatively lightweight, weighing between 90 and 140 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You are adept at hunting at night. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Bite. You have sharp fangs that enable you to make natural bite attacks. You can choose to bite as an unarmed strike that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage, which can be calculated using either your Strength or Dexterity modifier for both the attack roll and damage bonus. Evasive. You add your Intelligence modifier as a bonus on all Dexterity saving throws. Bewitching Guile. You can cast charm person as a 1st level spell with this trait, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast ambush prey as a 2nd level spell with this trait, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast fear with this trait, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Languages.

While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning. Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed. Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids. Warforged Personality The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them. The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning. The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity. The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating. Quirks Warforged often display an odd personality trait or two, given how new they are to the world. The Warforged Quirks table contains example quirks. Warforged Quirks d8 Quirk 1 You analyze—out loud—the potential threat posed by every creature you meet. 2 You often misread emotional cues. 3 You are fiercely protective of your friends. 4 You try to apply wartime discipline to every situation. 5 You don’t know how to filter your feelings and are prone to dramatic emotional outbursts. 6 You don’t understand clothing beyond its utility and assume it denotes a person’s function. 7 You are obsessed with your appearance and constantly polish and buff yourself. 8 War is the only thing that makes sense to you, and you’re always looking for a fight. Warforged Names Most warforged were assigned numerical designations for use in military service. Many of them adopted nicknames, often given to them by their comrades. As independent individuals, some have chosen new names as a way to express their path in life. A few take on human names, often the name of a fallen friend or mentor. Warforged Names: Anchor, Banner, Bastion, Blade, Blue, Bow, Cart, Church, Crunch, Crystal, Dagger, Dent, Five, Glaive, Hammer, Iron, Lucky, Mace, Oak, Onyx, Pants, Pierce, Red, Rod, Rusty, Scout, Seven, Shield, Slash, Smith, Spike, Temple, Vault, Wall Warforged Traits Your warforged character has the following traits. A few of the traits give you a choice; consider how your choice reflects the purpose for which your character was built. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Age. A typical warforged is between two and thirty years old. The maximum warforged lifespan remains a mystery; so far, warforged have shown no signs of deterioration due to age. You are immune to magical aging effects. Alignment. Most warforged take comfort in order and discipline, tending toward law and neutrality. But some have absorbed the morality, or lack thereof, of the beings with which they served. Size. Your size is Medium. To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier: Size modifier = 2d6 Height = 5 feet + 10 inches + your size modifier in inches Weight in pounds = 270 + (4 × your size modifier) Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Constructed Resilience. You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits: You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe. You are immune to disease. You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Sentry’s Rest. When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal. Integrated Protection. Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor: You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor other than a shield, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way. While you live, the armor incorporated into your body can’t be removed from your body against your will. Specialized Design. You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Eberron - Rising from the Last War"},{"name":"Wasteland Dragonborn","description":"Dragonborn who are native to the wastelands can trace their lineage back to dragons that might have ruled over vast stretches of ruins or other places made desolate by magical forces or eldritch corruption.

Some wasteland dragonborn spend their lives patrolling the borders of their blasted domains in an effort to keep away any who might further despoil the land. Others actively explore their environment, looking for treasures to enrich the land or themselves. WASTELAND DRAGONBORN TRAITS Your wasteland dragonborn character has the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size. You are Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Breath Weapon. You can use your action to exhale a bright beam of force energy in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Bite. You have a fanged maw that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normally dealt by an unarmed strike. Draconic Resistance. You have resistance to force damage.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":25357},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Wastes of Chaos"},{"name":"Wasteland Orc","description":"At first glance, the orcs of the wastelands seem little different from their mountain- or forest-dwelling brethren. But they are in some ways more predictable and less savage than other orcs and will sometimes interact with other humanoids for trade or companionship. Of course, when circumstances permit, wasteland orcs enjoy bloodshed and war just as much as their kin. LEAN AND LANKY Wasteland orcs are noticeably thinner and taller than other orcs, with wiry, muscular frames. Their skin tone also tends to be of different hues, with tan, orange, or yellowish skin being common and grayish or greenish skin rare. Their hair is coarse and typically dark brown or black, though bone-white or ashen hair is not unheard of. Wasteland orcs have the general facial features of other orcs, with jutting tusks and flat, broad noses. Unlike regular orcs, however, their eyes are slanted and surrounded by thick folds of skin that protect them from stinging dust and airborne pollutants. LEARNING THE LAND Few humanoids are more adept at surviving in the wastes than wasteland orcs, because of their ability to locate fresh water, sniff out potential danger, and resist the effects of chaotic magic. Young wasteland orcs are taught all the skills they need to survive in a harsh world, and they know from an early age that failure to learn these lessons leads to a quick death. Though dealing with wasteland orcs can be challenging, they have been known to guide travelers through dangerous areas or serve as guards for merchants passing through the badlands. Some wasteland orc tribes engage in primitive protection rackets, protecting caravans that travel through their territory from attacks by bandits or dust goblins in return for a suitable “donation.” WASTELAND SETTLERS Wasteland orcs live in heavily fortified camps where they engage in practices that other orcs would see as ludicrous or unbecoming, such as vegetable farming and the raising of goats and other livestock. While this way of life might seem strange to onlookers, wasteland orcs understand that relying on hunting and raiding for sustenance in the desolate wastes is a surefire way to risk starvation. Almost every wasteland orc encampment features a fighting pit or similar location where young orcs can test their mettle against prisoners, fierce animals, and monsters such as owlbears. A visitor to one of these strongholds can earn the orcs’ respect by stepping into a fighting pit and coming out alive. WASTELAND ORC TRAITS Your wasteland orc character has the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age. Wasteland orcs reach adulthood at the age of 14. Most wasteland orcs rarely reach 30 years of age because of the threats that exist in the barren lands. Wasteland orcs who take up residence in more civilized settings typically survive twice as long. Alignment. Wasteland orcs are not as chaotic in temperament as other orcs. Many of them tend toward neutrality, but no orcs in the wasteland are ever lawful. Good-aligned wasteland orcs are rare but not unheard of. Size. Wasteland orcs tower over most other humanoids, most reaching upward of 8 feet in height, but are still considered Medium creatures. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Aggressive. You can use a bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature that you can see. Chaos Resistance. You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects that have the chaos descriptor and against the special attacks and spell-like abilities of chaotic aberrations and fiends. Wasteland Awareness. You have proficiency in the Wisdom (Survival) skill. In addition, you apply double your proficiency bonus to checks for this skill when you try to locate fresh, unpolluted drinking water or when you want to determine whether an area is free of dangerous creatures or hazards. Wasteland Resilience. You can survive for extended periods without sustenance. You can go without food or water for a number of days equal to 6 + twice your Constitution modifier before you begin to suffer the effects of exhaustion. In addition, the heavy folds of skin around your eyelids grant you advantage on saving throws against the effects of airborne dust particles and similar substances that could cause blindness or otherwise impair your vision. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Orcish.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Wastes of Chaos"},{"name":"Water Genasi","description":"Genasi Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and water—these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie’s magic. A typical genasi has a life span of 120 years. Water Genasi Traits Water genasi descend from marids, aquatic genies from the Elemental Plane of Water. Water genasi are perfectly suited to life underwater and carry the power of the waves inside themselves. Their skin is often shades of blue or green, sometimes a blend of the two. If they have a human skin tone, there is a glistening texture that catches the light, like water droplets or nearly invisible fish scales. Their hair can resemble seaweed, waving as if in a current, or it can even be like water itself. As a water genasi, you have the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race. Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. Acid Resistance. You have resistance to acid damage. Amphibious. You can breathe air and water. Call to the Wave. You know the acid splash cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the create or destroy water spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the water walk spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast create or destroy water or water walk with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race). Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":14934},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Mordenkainen Presents - Monsters of the Multiverse"},{"name":"Wicker","description":"Wicker \"I know the story of a wicker lady. She called herself Hild and lived in a Lutan village. A formidable warrior, Hild led numerous raids. But one night, deep inside the thick Halvan Forests, strangeness did happen. A score of her warriors fell to feed the worms, but Hild led the remainder of her bloodied party out to the coast and their longship. A great bonfire was stoked there on the beach and to the horror of her companions Hild used her own axe to chop at herself, she did. None had ever suspected that she was a wicker. Perhaps Hild herself had never known. But piece by piece she revealed her true self and cast the flesh of her former life to burn on the pyre, honoring her dead companions. She lived—and fought—alongside the Lutan for many more years, it is said.\" —Otis the Historian Woven together when the world was created, the wicker are unusual constructs. Though made from wood they are clearly separate and apart from the natural world. They were built for a purpose, but that purpose has long been forgotten. Some believe that Mirgal created them as a jest, others that Grimnir itself birthed them (maybe even to protect the world from Mirgal himself!) Creatures Without Purpose The wicker seek their own identity. Some have attempted to band together into communities of their own, while others travel the world with no knowledge that others like them exist. Yet, all taste a whisper of the primal magic used to create them and, like a moth drawn to flame, search for the source of that magic. Builders and Creators Most wicker have a drive to build—whether it be jewelry, weapons, or buildings. They love to create and to admire the creations of others. Wicker Names A wicker will tend to be named by those around it, perhaps for the forest where it is found or how it acted when first talked to. Within a community they may choose to name each other, taking on the names of the humans and other folk that surround them. Names: Agar, Bark, Booton, Brough, Cowick, Fand, Fothat, Glion, Growl, Halbrook, Isen, Kin, Lowen, Rivest, Roth, Tol, Vin. Wicker Traits The wicker have the following traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Age. Wicker do not age. You are immune to magical aging effects. Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race. Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet (20 feet if Small). Natural Armor. The tight and hard coils of wood used to build you provides you with a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. You still gain this bonus while wearing armor for which you have proficiency. Neither Alive nor Dead. You have several advantages over a normal creature. You do not need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. You are immune to disease and have advantage on saving throws against poisoning. You cannot unwillingly have your form altered by any spell or effect. Aversion to Fire. If you take fire damage, you have disadvantage on saving throws and ability checks until the end of your next turn. A Creator’s Soul. You begin play with proficiency in two tools of your choice. Built for a Purpose (Subrace). When you create your wicker choose either the Watcher or Builder subrace, which will grant additional special traits. Builder The builders are the bulk of the wicker folk. They wield a wide variety of odd tools, many of which have been grafted onto their bodies. Versatile, but uncertain of their role, these wicker search for a place in the world. A dd or Remove Limbs. During a long rest a wicker can add and remove limbs. They may only ever have one of the following: Two additional legs to increase their base walking speed by +10 feet. A tool arm (either of the two “creator’s soul” tools in the core race feature) which when used gives advantage to tool use checks. A shield arm that grants +1 to AC (can be used with another shield). A spiked or clubbed arm (1d6 piercing or bludgeoning damage plus your Strength modifier). Treated as a magical weapon at 7th level. Watcher These wicker are more cleverly constructed than the builders. Their wooden frame is hidden by neatly sculpted panels of wood and magic enlivens their facial features sufficient that they may pass as human, elf, gnome, or halfling (your choice when you select this race). Hidden. A suspicious NPC will only notice that the wicker is an artificial being after a minute of examination and a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Methods to sense or detect magic will register a wicker as magical. Persuasive. A watcher starts with proficiency in the Persuasion skill. Watchful. A watcher always has advantage when making Insight checks. Change is Inevitable. The watcher can tear off their facade and become a builder. This transformation takes one minute and is irrevocable. The wicker loses their Watcher features and, until they finish a long rest, they cannot use the builder’s Add or Remove Limbs trait.","properties":{"Category":"Races","Expansion":25792},"publisher":"Runic Tales Inc.","book":"Raiders of the Serpent Sea - Compendium"},{"name":"Wrothian","description":"\"And what did Alice and Bobby see coming out of the spaceship? Was it the blobby Amoeboids?\" \"No!\" the eager group of children responded in unison. \"Was it the silly Bird-People?\" \"No!\" the children repeated. \"Was it the beepy-boopy Vect?\" \"No!\" the children cried, sensing the end of storytime. \"No, it was the scary Wroth!\" the teacher grimaced and growled, \"It grinned with its sharp teeth and grabbed Alice and Bobby with its pointy nails!\" — A spacer’s storytime When most spacers are young, they hear a bedtime story about the wroth: fearsome invaders from beyond the stars that come by night to steal away bad little girls and boys. When they grow up, however, they only learn that the tale is far more terrible in reality. The dreaded wroth perhaps originate in the Black, for that is where they reside: in the endless space between worlds, where they can never be located and destroyed. They are a blight on the galaxy, arriving by night upon defenseless worlds to take humanoid captives with their ruthless alien machines, and slaughtering anyone that resists. When they are satisfied with their cruelty, they retreat with their captives, who are never to be seen again, into the interminable Black. The very word \"wroth\" can cause panic on Frontier worlds, where defenses are few and far between, but the wroth prey on worlds everywhere, from the galactic center to the uttermost edge of the 'verse. And as such, they are universally feared and despised. Imperfect Rogue Most consider wrothians to be wholly evil, an utter scourge of the Black; but by some providence, you were born different. Like all wrothian drones, you are created imperfect, using a fraction of the bio-matter allotted to the unholy primarchs. These primarchs rule over your kind, commanding you to go to the small, pale worlds below and take people to harvest their bio-matter and brains. Perhaps you were exiled from your ship for demonstrating some act of mercy, or perhaps you escaped to free yourself from the oppressive primarch regime. Regardless, you are now a Rogue, an enemy of all wroth and feared by all others. Few Friends, Many Enemies As a wrothian, there is no bastion you can call home, and you have no natural allies in the ‘verse. Depending on the circumstances of your exile, it is even possible you will be hunted by your former brethren. You might find company with groups of mercenaries and among adventuring parties which value your particular skills. Spacers tend to be wary around wrothians and wrothian technology, but, especially on the Galactic Frontier where hazards are abundant, a wrothian might be able to earn a crew’s trust, provided they can prove their worth as an ally. Most rogue wrothians, however, use disguises; usually of magical caliber. Even a simple disguise self spell can reliably masquerade a wrothian as another exotic species, such as a nautilid or skathári, for a time. Awaiting Oblivion In abandoning your life with the wroth, you have forsaken your immortality. Without the refreshment of psionic energy found on their ships, your body will break down and die in less than a decade. Perhaps this death will be a mercy to you, a final correction of your life's mistake, or perhaps you will seek some darker alternative to the oblivion that is death. At long last, however, your life's objective is your own, your destiny free to decide. Wrothian Names Names aren't bestowed on wrothian takers when they are created; under the primarchs, they have only silent, psionic designations that more closely resemble numbers. Rogue wrothians, however, choose their own names when they break free. These names tend to sound harsh, borrowing sounds from the Wrothian language, but carry great personal meaning to the wrothian that selected it. Wrothian Names. Ax’omn, Bael’deldist, Falct’maelom, Hry’steriost, Knu’crikolp, Saluh’ark, Tas’garnaacta, Troh’gelt, Vaek’lenthar, Xrau’tsidea, Zred’rrirc Wrothian Traits Almost completely uniform, wrothian takers that reject the primarchs have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma increases by 1. Age. All wrothians are synthetically engineered in a creation matrix, which rids them of the faults found in other organic lifeforms: they are ageless and don't require food or drink, as long as they are nourished by a field of psionic energy, such as those which encompass their ships. In exile from your ship, however, you will find no such nourishment, and will likely perish within 10 years. Alignment. Wrothians have always found the conceit of morality strange. After all, to their minds, all other life in the 'verse is simply beneath them, so empathy and other philosophical considerations are a waste of thought. As a rogue wrothian, you likely oppose the primarchs and their view, but a natural understanding of empathy might elude you, for your mind wasn't designed for it. Rogue wrothians can have alignments across the spectrum, but many skew toward evil out of habit. Size. All takers stand the same height—just over six feet tall—and are identical in every other dimension as well, though you might have some important defect that distinguishes you. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Accustomed to the endless, inimitable Black, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Neural Lock. You can use your action to freeze the nervous system of a humanoid creature you can see within 60 feet. This creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated and its speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn. After you use your neural lock, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Razor Teeth. Your sharp claws and teeth are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing or piercing damage (your choice) equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Repletion. In lieu of a true digestive system, your body is sustained by psionic energy it absorbed while aboard your ship. You don't need to eat or drink, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Telepathy. You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Wrothian. Wrothian is a language rarely spoken, and is written in complex, circular runes. Spoken aloud, it is a rhythmic language of rumbles, sibilants, and chirps, suited to a race with an articulate tongue.","properties":{"Category":"Races"},"publisher":"Mage Hand Press","book":"Dark Matter Starter Kit"},{"name":"Yuan-ti","description":"Yuan-ti were originally humans who transformed themselves into serpent folk through ancient rituals.
