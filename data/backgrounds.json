[{"name":"Acolyte","description":"These D&D 5E Free Basic Rules only contain a fraction of the races, subclasses, backgrounds, feats, items, monsters, spells, and other content available on Roll20. Check out the Player's Handbook to add dozens of more player options to the Charactermancer, the Dungeon Master's Guide to expand on the tools available for DMs, and the Monster Manual to add hundreds of more unique creatures (including token artwork) to fight! Acolyte You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric —performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power. Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny. Skill Proficiencies : Insight , Religion Languages : Two of your choice Equipment : A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Shelter of the Faithful As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle . You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple. Suggested Characteristics Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme. d8 Personality Trait 1 I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example. 2 I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. 3 I see omens in every event and action.

Whether you have mastered the trapeze, aerial silks, acro dance, or acrobalance, your mastery over your body is unmatched. You have traveled with the circus far and wide, displaying this mastery and entertaining crowds of people far and wide. You have learned to suppress your fear, facing dangerous stunts from heights that make others’ knees buckle; a trait that translates well to a life of adventure. Skill Proficiencies : Acrobatics , Athletics Languages : Two of your choice. Equipment : A pouch full of chalk, a set of traveler’s clothes, 50 ft of hempen rope, and a pouch containing 10 gp. Feature: Fearless As an acrobat, danger is part of the job. You often face towering heights, death-defying stunts, and risks where one small move could mean your death. Any fears you may have had in the past have been numbed to a point that allows you to concentrate through even the deadliest of stunts. You gain advantage on any saving throws against being frightened. Suggested Characteristics Acrobats thrive on adrenaline: the greater the challenge, the more intense the rush. They focus on keeping themselves in peak physical condition, as well as a devotion to continually pushing themselves to the limits of their capabilities. d8 Personality Trait 1 I have a mentor, whom I idolize and strive to be like in every way possible. 2 I have a lust for attention; the bigger the crowd the more impressive I can be. 3 I’m following in my family’s footsteps and yearn to impress them. 4 I have to stay in peak physical condition. Allowing my discipline to lapse could have grave consequences. 5 In my travels I have learned to fit in wherever I go, adapting quickly to local cultures. 6 If I believe I’m capable, I will attempt any feat of athleticism, especially if there is a wager involved. 7 I live life as if tomorrow will never come, because the tiniest slip could end it all. 8 There is always a greater challenge for me to face. d6 Ideal 1 Independence. At the end of the day, only I am in control of my fate. (chaotic) 2 Aspiration. I yearn for mastery of any skill I learn. (any) 3 People. The awe of a crowd brings me ultimate joy. (neutral) 4 No Limits. Nothing can stop me from pushing beyond all expectations. (chaotic) 5 Greed. I never turn down a chance to turn a profit with my talents. (evil) 6 Inspiration. Perhaps seeing me can inspire others to push their limits. (good) d6 Bond 1 I owe everything to the ringmaster who lifted me out of squalor and took me on the road with them. 2 I lost a loved one in a tragic accident. They are remembered through our shared love of the acrobatic art. 3 Every time I perform for a crowd, I will give them everything I have to give. 4 I want to be known far and wide, no matter what it costs me. 5 Persevering through pain only makes me stronger. 6 If something frightens me, I will face it and persevere. d6 Flaw 1 I purposely injured a fellow acrobat to further my career. 2 My numbness to fear allows me to unquestioningly put others in danger. 3 I am weak to temptation and vices, especially a night in the local tavern. 4 I obsessively pursue my goals, yearning for perfection. 5 I can never return home because of what I’ve done. The circus offered me an escape. 6 I pass judgement quickly, and often unfairly.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Escape Plan Games","book":"Tavern Tales Vol 1 - A Trip Away Inn"},{"name":"Activist Journalist","description":"You work to expose the harm caused by ruling powers through journalism. Maybe a local broadsheet or town crier employs you, or maybe this is how you spend your free time. Either way, the stories you investigate and report on have an impact on your community and your role within it. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Investigation Languages: Two of your choice and a journalist shorthand for taking notes Equipment: A set of common clothes, a scroll that you use to “map” important relationships between powerful figures in the city, a writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a penknife), and a pouch containing 10 gp Feature: You Can Trust Me You are known in your community as someone who can be trusted with valuable (potentially explosive) information. Community members—including those who hold power—may provide you with valuable information in the hopes that you’ll leak the information or investigate further. Other times, people may try to keep information from you or mislead you, which is a form of gathering information itself! If you don’t protect your sources and their identities, there will be consequences (determined by the GM). Suggested Characteristics Citizen journalists are determined to uncover the truth—wherever it’s hidden and no matter how difficult or dangerous it is to get—and bring it into the open. They’re dogged when they’re pursuing stories and will wade into unfamiliar or threatening situations to get the information they need. They might be the type to spend hours with their head buried in tomes and blueprints and official records, or someone who’s out in the streets day in and day out, looking for leads and sources.

To truly understand the heavens, we must sail their seas and experience all its glory. Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Religion Languages One language of your choice Equipment A depleted aetherium crystal, a book of general elemental knowledge, an astral compass, and a pouch containing 5 gp Bonus Trait Focused Mind Officer Progression: If you use the optional Seafarer Advancement Rules (see chapter 7), this background increases your officer station rank by one in a single officer station chosen from navigator or helmsperson Feature: Planar Affinity Your devotion to the Aetherial Expanse has somehow manifested within you, an affinity for the elemental planes. Once a day, you can open yourself to one of the elements: earth, air, fire, or water. In doing so, you may choose one of the following abilities: You create a minor breeze to blow through a small area. You call forth a fingerling of fire to dance on the tip of your hand. You create a tiny, earthen statue made of stone and plant life. With a touch, you bring moisture to the driest of things. You make a 3-inch square of dampness. Suggested Characteristics Aetherial Mystics come from many walks of life; however, most tend to be curious, seeking adventure to find enlightenment in the mortal realms, and exploring the unknown in search of divine knowledge. Personality Trait D8 Personality Trait 1 To hide my insecurities, I am boisterous and loud. I use bravado to distract those around me. 2 Hope is the true path of the gods. I am overly positive, constantly spouting platitudes and encouragement. 3 Fire burns in my blood, tempering me. I am quick to anger and forgive, holding my passions tightly. 4 I emulate water’s steady course. I am serene, hoping others take solace from my presence. 5 The stability of earth rules my soul. I am firm in my beliefs and take time to make decisions. 6 The plane of air blows through my mind. I flit through topics, and I see things others miss. 7 Nature echoes uniquely in my soul. I manifest random personality traits of both natural and planar creatures. 8 Hesitation is a weakness and must be rooted out. Experience is everything. Ideal D6 Ideal 1 Destiny. The gods grant everyone the possibility of a great destiny. I must shepherd those around me to reach their full potential. 2 Divinity. I seek the true source of aether so that I might bathe in the presence of the gods. 3 Service. I must teach and train those interested in meditation and self-reflection. 4 Leadership. People are like children, always squabbling. I must make difficult decisions for them. 5 Champion. Life is harsh and I stand up for those in need, even if they do not wish it. 6 Learning. I seek to understand the aetherial waters and unlock the secrets hidden beneath its waves. Bond d6 Bond 1 The planes were once one, and I strive to unite them once more. 2 I seek to save the souls of those who traverse the planes by being their holy mystic. 3 I have a great destiny and am single-minded in my drive to walk my true path. 4 Nature is a distilled form of aether, and to travel its waters is to live in true harmony. 5 I seek to widen all the elemental portals to allow more of the aether to spread. 6 The gods live in the unknown depths of the seas. One day, I will greet them with reverence. Flaw d6 Flaw 1 I am patient, seeking to see the twists and turns of life as they end without interference. 2 I have a sweet and trusting disposition, no matter how cruel or unkind the world has been. 3 I desire to serve the greater good, going to extremes and putting myself in danger unnecessarily. 4 Having gone without for most of my life, I become jealous of those who have things I do not. 5 Everything ends, and our actions don’t matter. I push for acceptance instead of trying to better them. 6 Even the nicest of people are plotting to hurt me, and I live my life waiting to be proven right.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":32048},"publisher":"Ghostfire Gaming","book":"Aetherial Expanse Setting Guide"},{"name":"Agasha Family - Dragon Clan","description":"The Agasha family’s teachings cover religious rites, including powerful invocations to the spirits, and the family’s knowledge represents generations of tireless research. But unlike many theologians, their beliefs and methods are ever-evolving like the elements in nature. Although founded by a pacifist, many of their techniques are invaluable in a fight. Once devoted predominantly to mysticism, they now combine it with the practical arts of naturalism and scientific observation to get greater effect than either could achieve alone. In their pursuit of knowledge, the Agasha family’s studies have delved deeply into alchemy, metallurgy, and medicine. Their current traditions blend the practical effects of chemistry and construction with the mystical effects of calling the spirits. Skill Proficiencies: Medicine, choose one other Intelligence-based skill (Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion). Tool Proficiencies: Alchemist’s kit, one artisan tool of your choice. Weapon Proficiencies: Wakizashi. Languages: You can read, sign, speak, and write Rokugani and one other common language of your choice. Equipment: Sanctified robes, wakizashi, vial pouch (quiver), alchemist’s kit, one artisan tool of your choice, and 8 gp. Background Feature: Life in the Mountains You have lived in the rugged mountains of Dragon lands for much of your life and know the environment and culture well, granting you the following benefits: You know who within your clan has been awarded membership into the Inner Circle of Togashi, although you would not be privy to the secrets of the Inner Circle unless you are also a member. You know more about monastic life and traditions than most other clans, having likely interacted with the Togashi Order throughout your life. Due to the rugged nature of your homeland, you know how to properly prepare mountain flora and wildlife for human consumption. You have a working understanding of many physical phenomena of the natural world and the beauty and dangers present in wild lands. Suggested Feats A set of suggested feats that reflect the Dragon Clan’s traditions and training can be found in chapter 5.

Amidst its towers, scholars pursue truths of the world, the universe, and human nature, advancing sciences such as chemistry, physics, alchemy, and astronomy. Al-Zawira is renowned for the skill of its physicians as well, who are said to be able to reattach severed limbs and even stir life back into the recently deceased. For over five hundred years since its founding under Caliph Mahmoud ibn Mansur, the rulers of the Qamarist Caliphate have made Al-Zawira their capital. While not the largest city on the continent by population or size, all who cross the King’s River on the Bridge of Boats are sure to be taken in by its grandeur, and its Market of Books is a destination of dreams for any scholar. It is said that if a piece of knowledge exists in the world of mortals, it has passed through this city. Given the size of the Qamarist Caliphate, Al-Zawira is quite cosmopolitan, with residents from the far-flung corners of the Caliphate and beyond. However, the city has a distinct personality all its own as well, for the search for knowledge underpins much of the activity that goes on there.

You know the lay of the land where you grew up extremely well and know many people in that region. You know the trade that you grew up around well, even if you do not practice it yourself. Because you are from outside of Rokugan, members of Rokugani courts and other political organizations view you as being neutral to their conflicts. They do not assume that you favor a particular side, and might go to extra lengths to sway you to theirs if they think you are an asset who might help them.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":26129},"publisher":"Edge Studio","book":"Adventures in Rokugan"},{"name":"Amazon of Perunalia","description":"A strong daughter of a mighty nation, you are among the most elite warriors of matriarchal Perunalia.

If you spend 1 hour maintaining your weapons and ammunition, for the next 24 hours you can recover all arrows that miss their target by spending 1 minute searching at the end of an encounter. Further, you decorate your arrows with colored fletching that denotes your rank among the amazons. You begin at the lowest rank with white fletching. Every 4 levels, you advance to the next color: green, blue, black, and finally red. You can expect deference and respect from any amazon you outrank, just as you are expected to defer to an amazon who outranks you. Suggested Characteristics Amazons of Perunalia are universally confident and well-educated, but they hold a default assumption of men as the weaker sex with manifest mental and behavioral faults. Amazons are disdainful of men in power because of the long, sad history of patriarchal nations and armies. Beyond their particular assumptions, amazons tend to be shrewd and proud of their skill. d8 Personality Traits 1 I live for the thrill of victory. 2 I admire other cultures with traditions of archery. 3 Anyone who fights with skill deserves my respect, men and women alike. 4 The care I take in maintaining my bow and fashioning my arrows is an important part of archery, and archery is the core of who I am. 5 When I display my bow skill well, I always offer thanks to Perun for his teachings. 6 Men in positions of authority must work hard to earn my trust. 7 I dislike frivolity and nonsense. 8 My nerve is as steady as an arrow’s flight. d6 Ideal 1 Service.

One day I will see that enemy defeated. d6 Flaw 1 I secretly resent the Duchess’s policies, and I’m sympathetic to others that might seek to take control of the Duchy. 2 There is a piece of lore forbidden to me, but I’m obsessed with obtaining it. 3 I can’t let them know how much I resent all the years I’ve sacrificed on my archery training instead of doing what I love. 4 I look down on anyone who lacks skill with a bow. 5 I’m unswerving in my devotion to upholding the Duchess’ law, no matter who broke it. 6 I’ll never admit a fault to a man, and only rarely to another woman.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Ambulant","description":"Grinders, umbrella menders, nomads, seasonal workers, wayfarers, street actors, thespians, harlequins, puppeteers, carnies, charlatans, relic peddlers, beggars, wandering clerics, students moving from one school to another, professional wanderers, toy makers, tinsmiths, milliners, Norcitans, lacklands, ziganes and caravankers, and all those who spend their lives moving from region to region looking for work or taking their itinerant shows around: these are ambulants. The presence and constant transit of ambulants across the Kingdom’s cities and villages is a common occurrence, and they are mostly viewed with interest and curiosity, as a breath of fresh air in people’s humdrum life. Constantly on the move, these wanderers have very variegated cultures, but also many common traits: the lack of roots, songs and prayers of the road, pleasure in a freer life, and strong sense of communion between travelers, compared to their non-migratory counterparts, the “paisàn”.

Whenever you collect one or more rumors, you get an additional one. You always have advantage on all checks related to finding or traveling on Roads to Nowhere.

In all of them burns an on-the-road restlessness, not unlike that of sailors... a sedentary existence is too boring to live! d6 Personality Trait 1 I often speak in Racket and use derisive terms or mockery toward the settled-ones, such as \"Paisàn\". 2 I am reliable and trustworthy. I always find the solution to every problem. 3 I am a restless dreamer, and it's not easy for me to sit still for more than a week in one place. 4 I like to know every single detail of any places I visit. The world of the settled-ones is full of wonders they don't even know about. 5 I indulge in the pleasures of life, and I do not deprive myself of anything. 6 I'm passionate about art and all other creative expressions. I aspire to unravel the secret recipe of a successful performance. 7 I often use fascinating tones, catchy phrases, and stage names, and you'll never see me out of character. 8 I follow my community's fashion and lifestyle, and I do everything I can to distinguish myself from the paisàns. d6 Ideal 1 Brotherhood. Ambulant or settled-one, citizens or peasant, wild or civilized, people are all the same and should get along well. (Good) 2 Respect. Even if strange or convoluted, the customs and the laws of the settled-ones' cities and communities must be respected. (Lawful) 3 Common Sense. There are as many norms and truths as there are human heads, and it is impossible to consider them all: the important thing is to follow common sense. (Chaotic) 4 Self-Interest. All these people are waiting to be conned. And if you do it in style, they'll even say thank you while you scam them. (Evil) 5 Law of the Road.

You’ve been raised to revere and protect the natural world, and to shepherd the tumultuous elemental forces that give it life. When the elements threaten to overwhelm the delicate balance of nature, it is the role of the Ashari to restore harmony. You grew up in a tight-knit society, bound to a leader who successfully returned from the traditional journey to the Elemental Planes known as an Aramante. By contrast, you might well have never traveled more than a few days from your home, and thus have closer bonds with your family and neighbors than many people of Tal’Dorei. In your early life, you likely took up one of the many roles that make up your society, whether homemaker, hunter, explorer, or protector. If you have the ability to use elemental magic, you might have had one of the most important duties of all: protecting and soothing the elemental rift at the heart of your home. And even as an adventurer now traveling far beyond that home, your loyalties still lie with the continued safety of your order. Whatever else you do as you learn about the new world around you, you’re conscious of the need to gather allies to your cause. Each Ashari is tethered to one of the four elemental orders and their settlements. You must select Pyrah (fire), Vesrah (water), Terrah (earth), or Zephrah (wind). The rifts of earth and air are both in Tal’Dorei. If you live or lived among your people, then you are familiar with the remarkable sights of Air Ashari on skysails above the Summit Peaks, or Earth Ashari erupting from the solid stone of the Cliffkeep Mountains on their earthboards . Skill Proficiencies: Nature, plus your choice of Arcana or Survival Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism kit Languages: Primordial (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran, depending on the elemental affinity of your tribe) Equipment: A set of traveler’s clothes, a staff carved with symbols of your tribe, an herbalism kit, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Elemental Harmony Growing up surrounded by wild elemental magics has attuned your senses to those chaotic forces, enabling you to subtly bend them to your will. As an action, you channel minor magic involving the element of your chosen Ashari order, giving you one of the following abilities: Pyrah. You instantaneously create and control a burst of flame small enough to light a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. Alternatively, you snuff out a flame of the same size. Terrah. You instantaneously create a small rock no larger than a gold coin. The rock appears in your hand, then turns to dust after 1 minute. Vesrah. You instantaneously create enough hot or cold water to fill a small drinking vessel. Zephrah. You create an instantaneous puff of wind strong enough to blow papers off a desk or mess up someone’s hair. Suggested Characteristics The Ashari hold themselves removed from the rest of Tal’Dorei by their own choice. This makes many Ashari naive to the ways of the world beyond their homes—but it can also make them determined, steadfast, and tightly focused on their goals. Ever since Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest and leader of the Zephrah, became a world-renowned hero, the Air Ashari at least have become more familiar to Tal’Dorei’s other peoples. They are known to welcome outsiders to their mountaintop enclave, and to take on quests that force them to leave their isolated home.

Ashari Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I like to keep my hands busy, no matter where I am. 2 I love to explore new places and meet new people. 3 I meditate at dawn each day—and I can’t stand it when my routine is interrupted. 4 I like noticing patterns in the world around me, whether or not they mean anything. 5 I don’t let anything—or anyone—stand in the way of my mission. 6 I’m a plain talker, even with people who outrank me. 7 I’ve always got some of my native element with me in some form. (This might be modeling clay, pure water, special burning incense, or a bottled cloud.) 8 I talk with everyone like I’ve known them all my life. Because most people I know, I have known all my life! Ashari Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Destiny. I believe that everyone has a role to play. Now I just have to find mine. (Neutral) 2 Community. It’s important to surround yourself with people you can count on, and who will support you. (Good) 3 Knowledge. I want to learn everything I can about the Elemental Planes—and maybe even visit them myself. (Neutral) 4 Freedom. I don’t care what anyone says. Even if it causes problems, the elements must be free. And so should I. (Chaotic) 5 Structure. The elements are in harmony when they are free to act as they will, within the safe boundaries set by the Ashari. People are much the same. (Lawful) 6 Virtuous Cycle. If I see someone who needs help, I feel compelled to assist them. Surely they’ll return the favor someday! (Good) Ashari Bonds d6 Bond 1 I have a cousin in another Ashari tribe whom I’ve never met, but someday I want to visit my extended family. 2 The leader of my tribe thinks I could be their successor, but I worry that I don’t have enough experience to lead my people. 3 A mysterious person killed a member of my family. I’ve left home to discover who the killer was—and to seek vengeance. 4 My older sibling set out on their Aramante a year ago, and I haven’t seen them since. 5 When I was a baby, a giant eagle brought me to Zephrah. I love my family, but I often wonder who my birth parents are. 6 I trust my animal friends more than any humanoid ally. Ashari Flaws d6 Flaw 1 Big cities are overwhelming. I get nervous when surrounded by people I don’t know. 2 I know all too well that elemental power is dangerous—but I like playing around with it anyway. 3 I get surly if I go too long without being in contact with my native element. 4 I think the mission of my people is a fool’s errand. They should abandon isolation, let the elements be, and enjoy the pleasures of the world! 5 I can’t stand it when people say one thing and mean another! Just say what you mean! 6 Ugh, I know it’s not right, but I can’t help but look down on people who can’t manipulate the elements. It’s not like it’s hard!","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Darrington Press","book":"Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn"},{"name":"Astral Drifter","description":"For longer than you can remember, you have traversed the Astral Sea.

This ensures that everyone knows what their job is and lessens confusion in the heat of a robbery. You can select your bandit specialty from the Bandit Specialty table, or roll randomly. d6 Bandit Specialty 1 Lookout 2 Lifter 3 Thug 4 Runner 5 Hustler 6 Captain Lookouts typically watch the roads for any signs of Perch Guard patrols, signalling the team to bail if a heist looks too risky. They also keep an eye out for potential marks. Lifters are the specialist thieves of an operation. They are usually as adept at pick-pocketing as they are at sneaking up behind a cart to liberate its valuables. Thugs are the muscle of a bandit group, and use their size and strength to intimidate merchants into giving up without a fight. They also keep other bandits in line, at the captain’s discretion. Runners are the messengers and scouts of the Coalition, serving to smuggle pilfered goods to fences. Additionally, they pass information throughout the different camps of the organization. Their job often finds them working alone which makes them particularly vulnerable. Hustlers are inveterate con-artists. Through careful planning and execution, their diversions can keep cart drivers occupied just long enough for the lifters to do their work, or create a seamless opening for an ambush. Captains are the glue that holds each bandit team together, providing leadership, and stamping out dissention where necessary, often with force. They are figures that inspire with their skill and bravado. Feature: Bandit Routes As someone who once assisted in countless highway robberies, you are familiar with the roads of the Wood and escape paths used by bandits. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between locations that cut through forested areas twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.

The Church, a mentor, or the Radiant Order taught you the ways of the hunt, giving you the knowledge and skills needed to defend your city and yourself. Whether you were once a simple citizen turned protector or a seasoned veteran of the First War hardened by countless battles, you have become an essential line of defense against the darkness. Skill Proficiencies: Choose one between Acrobatic or Athletics; and one between Medicine or Survival Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism kit Equipment: A set of common clothes, a trophy from a beast you've slain, a hunter’s kit (includes 20 lead bullets, a silvered dagger, a flare, and a silver flask), a healer’s kit, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp. Feature: Born of the Hunt Your continuous battles against the beasts have fortified your body and mind against the horrors of the Scourge. When an aberration or beast forces you to make a saving throw against the frightened condition, you gain a bonus on saving throws equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally, you share a strong bond with fellow hunters, allowing you to request favors from them. Suggested Characteristics As a Beast Hunter, you have dedicated your life to combating the Scourge and the monsters it creates. Your constant exposure to the horrors of the plague has hardened you, yet beneath the cold exterior, you harbor a deep compassion for those who suffer from it. D8 Personality Trait 1 I keep my emotions under control, for I fear the day I lose control over them and my humanity. 2 I am stoic, rarely showing any signs of distress. The beasts smell fear. 3 I have a crude sense of humor. Laughter keeps the fear at bay. 4 I am haunted by the beasts I have slain. 5 I am deeply spiritual. I believe the Church is our only hope for salvation. 6 I value strength above all else. The weak will not survive. 7 I am always alert. Danger can appear at any moment. 8 I am fiercely protective of my fellow citizens. D6 Ideal 1 Protection. It is my duty to protect the innocent from the Scourge. (Good) 2 Anger. The beasts must pay for the lives they've taken. (Chaotic) 3 Faith. I trust in the Church. Their wisdom guides my blade. (Lawful) 4 Survival. The most important thing is to survive another night. (Neutral) 5 Cunning. Understanding my prey is key to trapping, torturing and otherwise defeating them. (Evil) 6 Courage. I must stand tall in the face of fear. Only then can I inspire others to do the same. (Good) D6 Bond 1 The Church trained me and I owe them my life. 2 I hunt to avenge my loved ones taken by the Scourge. 3 I fight to protect the people of my neighborhood. 4 I am hunting a specific beast that took a part of me. 5 My weapon is a symbol of my duty and a keepsake from a mentor. 6 The war veterans taught me everything I know about fighting.

You walked its ley‑infused streets and studied among the gleaming spires that touch the sky. During your time in the arcane city, you ate, drank, slept, and breathed magic, and now you carry that legacy into the world. Students with no arcane aptitude are rare, but nonmagical scholars do arise from Bemmea's crackling skyline. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Investigation Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A book of lore, a set of fine clothes, five sheets of parchment, a quill and inkwell, and a pouch containing 15 gp Focus of Study: Years of study at one of the many prestigious academies in Bemmea has earned you specialized knowledge of one exotic subject.

Even subtle phenomena or hidden creatures don't escape your notice for long. If you spend 8 hours in the vicinity of your focus of study, you pick up on telltale clues and signs that reveal its general presence. This doesn't pierce disguises or reveal its exact location, and you must investigate by normal or magical means to pinpoint it. Suggested Characteristics The citizens of Bemmea are fiercely proud of their accumulated knowledge, and many are reluctant to share their hard-won prize with outsiders. Bemmeans are keenly aware of laws and often exhibit strange quirks of behavior or speech that seem almost superstitious but have an actual, legal basis in their home. d8 Personality Traits 1 I won't drink healing potions at dusk unless it's a matter of life or death. 2 Those with no magical talent aren't worth my time, and divine spellcasters only slightly less so. 3 I'm most at home while studying or lecturing others, and I'm horribly uncomfortable anywhere else. 4 I never pass up the chance to share some scrap of trivia regarding my focused studies. If a good opportunity doesn't present itself, I'll make one. 5 I take time every day to cleanse foreign influences from spellbooks, holy symbols, or magical items. 6 I constantly note the surrounding terrain or the layout of construction, looking for magical significance. 7 When I encounter a new creature, I get lost in gathering information and noting observations. 8 I sometimes take strange, roundabout routes when I travel from place to place. d6 Ideal 1 Compliance. Rules exist for a reason. We must follow them, and punish those that don't. (Lawful) 2 Greater Good. Sometimes we must sacrifice personal convenience for the good of others. (Good) 3 Stability. The world constantly veers toward extremes; the knowledge exists to keep it on an even keel. (Neutral) 4 Preservation. We enjoy great knowledge because those who came before passed it down. We must follow their example. (Any) 5 Forbidden Knowledge. Proscribed lore hides the key to true power. (Evil) 6 Free Information. Secrets are destructive; knowledge is the birthright of all. (Chaotic) d6 Bond 1 I unleashed something during my time studying, and I know I must face it some day. 2 The academy is the only real home I've ever known. 3 I learned a terrible secret while studying, and I'm searching for a way to defeat it before it's too late. 4 One day the mighty mages of Bemmea will look up to me in awe. 5 One teacher at the academy where I studied saw my potential and gave me a second chance. Some day I'll repay the favor. 6 When I'm ready, I'll take students of my own and pass on what I've learned. d6 Flaw 1 While studying, I broke an esoteric law that seemed harmless at the time. If anyone finds out, there will be hell to pay. 2 I brought ruin upon my mentor so I could escape with a piece of secret lore. 3 My curiosity quashes my fear. One day that'll be the death of me. 4 I stole the identity and position of another to enter the academy. 5 No matter how hard I study or how much I achieve, my family never seems satisfied. 6 I become intensely jealous of anyone who commands stronger magic than I can.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Bhavyatapura - Non-Rokugani","description":"The central region of the Ivory Kingdoms is dominated by a vast plateau known as the Sonagiri, or \"Golden Mountain.\" Ringed by soaring, snowcapped mountains and cut by the mighty Heeratand, or \"River of Diamonds,\" the expansive and fertile Sonagiri is the most densely populated part of the Ivory Kingdoms. Bhavyatapura, the \"City of Spendor,\" occupies the Heeratand in the center of the Sonagiri. Although they are collectively known as Sheelavaan, which simply means “urbane,” the people of Bhavyatapura are diverse in the extreme, comprising a multitude of ethnicities, social castes, languages, religious beliefs, and cultural backgrounds. As their name implies, the Sheelavaan are generally sophisticated, gregarious, and eloquent. They are used to living in the cramped confines of a massive city; many find the rural countryside and wilderness areas quite off-putting. Most Sheelavaan are accustomed to bargaining and cajoling their way through a complex web of barter economies and currency systems, a skill that they readily apply to nearly any sort of commercial, social, or cultural interaction. They also have a tendence to learn a few languages, an important skill when living in a place where the dominant tongue may change several times along the length of a single street. Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, choose one other Intelligence-based skill (Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion). Tool Proficiencies: Any one tool of your choice, vehicles (land).

You know the lay of the land where you grew up extremely well and know many people in that region. You know the trade that you grew up around well, even if you do not practice it yourself. Because you are from outside of Rokugan, members of Rokugani courts and other political organizations view you as being neutral to their conflicts. They do not assume that you favor a particular side, and might go to extra lengths to sway you to theirs if they think you are an asset who might help them.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":26129},"publisher":"Edge Studio","book":"Adventures in Rokugan"},{"name":"Blacksmith","description":"Every rusty sword you find at the bottom of a dungeon, every piece of armour that has saved its wearer from a piercing arrow, every spear tip, dagger, and shield, all were made by blacksmiths.

Additionally, you recognize the environmental effects of a forge, allowing you to identify if an area has been utilized to perform a smith's work.

As a member of the Blood Sisters, you were accorded respect and often fear on account of your status if your temple was located within the Principalities. Beyond Morgau's borders, however, the goddess' worship would have been forbidden and you would have honored her in secret. You are not necessarily a cleric—the Red Sisterhood contains plenty of lay worshippers too — but you are adept at performing bloody sacrifices in Marena's honor and are well-versed in her Scarlet Commandments and other holy texts. You are no stranger to orgiastic rites honoring her as the goddess of lust, and if you served in Cantri Abbey, you may have learned the art of midwifery from working in the Cradle. From time to time you may have been called upon to mete out punishment to those who transgressed against the goddess' rules or the laws of the Blood Kingdom. Now you have left your temple to strike out on your own. Perhaps you have tired of the endless bloodshed the Red Goddess demands and have abandoned her worship? Or maybe you were sent forth by your temple's high priestess to evangelise in Marena's name and bring new converts into the fold? Skill Proficiencies: Medicine, Religion Tool Proficiencies: Disguise Kit Languages: One of your choice Equipment: Holy symbol of Marena, a copy of the Book of Holy Lust or the Scarlet Commandments, blood red vestments, a human skull stained with ochre, a set of common clothes, a sacrificial knife, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp. Feature: Fearful Respect When you travel openly as a Blood Sister within the Principalities, you will be afforded hospitality by the local people who both fear and respect you. You will be offered a decent meal, wine or beer, and a warm bed for the night at the village inn, and you will be granted an audience with the local ruler if you need one. Outside Morgau, you can give the secret hand signals and pass phrases needed to be granted safe haven and free healing at the Red Goddess' hidden temple in the city. Suggested Characteristics Blood Sisters have a dark past as servants of the Red Goddess and this is often reflected in their personalities. Ideals and bonds will be shaped by whether or not a Sister is still a member of the cult, or has renounced the Red Goddess' teachings. A Blood Sister's flaws are sometimes linked to the tenets and practices of Marena's worship; sometimes a ritual act becomes a vice in which she takes twisted pleasure, or an obsession over which she has little control. d8 Personality Traits 1 When you have seen as many terrible things as I have, you make the most of every happy moment. 2 I am afforded respect wherever I go, and rightly so. 3 Being part of the Sisterhood has made it hard for me to connect with people in the outside world. 4 I flirt with others shamelessly to get what I want. 5 It is hard to win my trust, but once you have it, I will stick by you through thick and thin. 6 I take pleasure in inflicting pain on others. 7 Creatures of the night hold no fear for me. It's people I am wary of. 8 I often prefer my own company to that of others. d6 Ideal 1 Might. The Elders are our rightful rulers. The common folk are but cattle to feed our dark masters. (Evil) 2 Greater Good. I will do whatever I can to stop more innocent blood being spilt. (Good) 3 Tradition. The Scarlet Commandments show us the one true path. (Lawful) 4 Free Will. My time of taking orders is over—I'm in control of my own life now. (Chaotic) 5 People. I care more about my friends and family than the teachings of the Goddess. (Neutral) 6 Faith. The Red Goddess guides my actions and grants me ever-increasing strength and magical power. (Evil) d6 Bond 1 Someday I will return home to be with my vampire lover. 2 I have turned my back on the Red Sisterhood and seek redemption. 3 I will do anything to keep my family safe from harm. 4 I owe a debt to Lord Fandorin, Baron of Doresh, which must be repaid by the Winter Solstice. 5 I have a duty to the high priestess of my temple to spread the word of the Red Goddess wherever I go. 6 I have an ancient copy of the Song of Blood and Winter that reveals the true words of Marena before they were corrupted by heretical priestesses. I must keep it safe. d6 Flaw 1 The sight of blood is abhorrent to me. 2 I am addicted to sex and get easily distracted when I'm with people I find physically attractive. 3 I yearn to feel a vampire's teeth sink into my neck. 4 I am a sinner and must punish myself constantly.

The head of the Calamac family is Calamac Mala, a stout, ruddy-faced woman given to shouting and loud laughter. Her husbands and wives, sons and daughters, and a smattering of grandchildren, are the core of her ordu. Mala’s wealth, and her claim to fame, derives from her impressive herds of cattle. The beef and leather from these animals have given her whole family a formidable stature and ready access to the equipment necessary to support warriors, and Mala has great ambitions for her family, expecting them to achieve high ranks in the Moto hierarchy of the Unicorn clan based on their obvious strength and ferocity. Mala’s pale-blue yurt is only of modest size, but she spends little time in it, instead making herself “guest” of various spouses and children as she rotates through her family. A large leather banner, painted with a crescent moon that serves as her personal mon, marks whichever yurt currently is playing host to the Calamac matriarch. As suggested by her choice of heraldry, Mala and most of her family are Qamarist. The largest yurt in the ordu sits outside the regular line with its door facing west, toward the City of God. This yurt belongs to no one, and is used as a temple when the family gathers for prayer—and also as a feast hall, on nights when the family slaughters one or more of their cattle.

Songs and stories celebrating the adventuring exploits of your famous parent are widely known. Kids across the land grew up wishing they were you. But being the child of a famous adventurer wasn’t all hugs and kisses. You seldom saw your celebrity-adventurer parent, and when they were around, it was all about them and tales of slaying this demon or vanquishing that dragon. All too often, you’d be woken out of a sound sleep by someone standing outside your home screaming about the latest threat to the town, the region, or the world. In the end, all you have to show for your lineage is your name. Most of the family’s money went for consumables, from potions of healing and spell scrolls to copious amounts of dwarven ale.

You spent your childhood traveling with your family, using your abilities to evade your enemies and ensure the single-skins give you whatever you need. Your family is part of a wider network of changeling clans, and you can take advantage of the havens, traditions, and personas your people have sowed across the lands. Most travelers are changelings. If you’re not a changeling, you were born to a changeling parent and grew up around them; you may even use a disguise kit or illusion magic to mimic their abilities. As a traveler, you’re most comfortable on the move and dislike staying in any one place for too long. Your people’s traditions predate the laws of Galifar, and you have little attachment to any concept of nation or property; your first loyalty is to your family and your friends. Some travelers ignore the laws of the Five Nations, or even see tricking single-skins as a sport and enjoy defying them. However, most respect the people around them; if they acquire an item from a single-skin, they’ll compensate with something of equal value. Some sow chaos in the name of the Traveler, while others seek to understand people and serve as a bridge between cultures. What path do you follow? Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Insight Tool Proficiencies: Thieves’ tools Languages: Skin cant (see below). Equipment: A shiftweave garment (capable of shifting between five different outfits), one trinket of special significance, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp. Shiftweave The finest glamerweave is produced by the gnomes of Zilargo and the mage-tailors of Aundair. But shiftweave was first made by the Children of Jes, and today the finest transmuter-tailors are found among the traveler clans and the settled changeling communities. Shiftweave is a common magic item that can shift between up to five embedded patterns. While this is an especially useful tool for the traveler who has a different persona for each town, it’s just as valuable for an agent of the King’s Citadel or an entertainer who’s shifting from a session at a common tavern to clothes suitable to perform at a palace. Basic shiftweave can be purchased from House Cannith, but if you want the finest quality and the smoothest transformation, you should find a tailor in Dragoneyes or Blackleaf. Fledgling Persona Personas are important tools for traveler clans. Every clan has a set of shared personas, identities that have an established role in a particular region. But these personas need to be refreshed over time, and it’s your duty to develop a new persona that can be useful to the clan. Over the course of your adventuring career, you’re expected to establish useful connections and build a positive reputation for this identity. You can select your persona from the Personas table or roll randomly, then add details to develop them into a unique identity. Personas d8 Persona 1 Traveling merchant 2 Charismatic outlaw 3 Itinerant tinker 4 Wandering priest 5 Investigative reporter 6 Bounty hunter 7 Grim mercenary 8 Beloved storyteller Language: Skin Cant As a traveler, you have learned a secret language that allows you to silently convey messages to fellow changelings. This is an exotic language that can only be “spoken” by changelings, though members of other species can learn to understand it. Skin cant uses shifting patterns of scars, tattoos, and pigment. This allows you to convey a short message—a concept that can be expressed in six words or less—to anyone who knows the language and who can see you. Typically the message is something you maintain as part of your appearance; for example, in crafting your image, you might add a pattern of scars that tells other changeling travelers, “I need help” or “Everything I say is a lie.” You can also use this language to have a conversation—typically by manifesting symbols on the palm of your hand—with someone who is within 60 feet and able to see you. The shifting patterns can be noticed by other observers within 60 feet; if you wish to keep the conversation discrete, you can hide it with a Charisma (Deception) check opposed by the observer’s Wisdom (Perception or Insight) check. If you fail, it means the observer notices your shifting patterns, though they don’t understand the meaning unless they also know skin cant. Feature: The Right Face for The Job Traveler clans use well-established personas to secure shelter and information wherever they go. This could be a priest who will receive sustenance at the local temple, a folk hero who will be sheltered by the common people, or a veteran soldier who can always get a bed at the local garrison. When you’re approaching a new community, work with the DM to determine if there could be a persona with roots in that place; as long as you play that role, you can usually obtain modest food and lodging and gain access to local gossip. In addition, when you encounter other members of your clan, you can ask them for help or information, provided this doesn’t place them at risk. However, this is a two-way street; if another member of your clan approaches you with a reasonable request, you’re expected to provide assistance. Suggested Characteristics While changeling travelers can be tricksters and agents of chaos, others strive to support strangers and have a positive influence wherever they go. Are you a charming scoundrel, a devotee of the Traveler, or just trying to stay out of trouble? Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I love people and seek the stories of each stranger I meet. 2 I embrace all beliefs, trying a new religion every few days. 3 I feel obliged to humiliate arrogant and entitled people. 4 Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip. 5 I thrive on change and hate standing still. 6 I don’t just want to defeat my enemies; I want to make them look foolish. 7 I’m always looking for weaknesses in others to exploit. 8 I love uncovering secrets, whether arcane lore or mere gossip.

(Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 Someone died saving my life, but they live on through me as one of my personas. 2 I’ve inherited the persona of a great folk hero, but I’m afraid I can’t live up to their reputation. 3 I’ve inherited a persona that’s become known as an infamous villain, and I’m determined to redeem the identity. 4 My family was betrayed by a rival changeling clan, and I’m determined to avenge them. 5 I joined a criminal gang to learn useful skills, then abandoned the identity; I still care about my old comrades, but I’m afraid to go back. 6 I embarrassed a powerful noble I once served; their hired thugs are looking for me, but someone I love is still in their employ. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I don’t really understand the concept of “personal property.” 2 I consider a good story to be more important than the truth, and I’ll always add a little flair. 3 I’m suspicious of everyone and everything. 4 I live in the moment and never plan for the future. 5 If someone wrongs me, I won’t rest until I’ve taken revenge. 6 It’s difficult for me to be honest, even with my closest friends.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Keith Baker Presents","book":"Exploring Eberron"},{"name":"Chaos Child","description":"You were born in an area tainted by the forces of chaos, whether that be a demon-blighted wasteland, twisted, alien forest, or region of badlands marked with the ruins of an ancient fallen civilization.

Because others find your appearance strangely unsettling, they have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made against you.

Does something whisper back? 2 I am prone to sudden outbursts of emotion. 3 I giggle inappropriately at things that others find disgusting or terrifying. 4 Some people call me flighty.

You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts’ desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children’s books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re perfectly willing to use for your advantage. You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Comm⁠on sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but comm⁠on sense seems to be in short supply when you’re around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment—nothing more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust—can restore youth and vigor, and there’s a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you make them sound like the real deal. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Sleight of Hand Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, forgery kit Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, tools of the con of your choice (ten stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid, a set of weighted dice, a deck of marked cards, or a signet ring of an imaginary duke), and a pouch containing 15 gp Favorite Schemes Every charlatan has an angle he or she uses in preference to other schemes. Choose a favorite scam or roll on the table below. d6 Scam 1 I cheat at games of chance. 2 I shave coins or forge documents. 3 I insinuate myself into people’s lives to prey on their weakness and secure their fortunes. 4 I put on new identities like clothes. 5 I run sleight-of-hand cons on street corners. 6 I convince people that worthless junk is worth their hard-earned money. Feature: False Identity You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy. Suggested Characteristics Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their true selves behind the masks they construct. They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues. d8 Personality Trait 1 I fall in and out of love easily, and am always pursuing someone. 2 I have a joke for every occasion, especially occasions where humor is inappropriate. 3 Flattery is my preferred trick for getting what I want. 4 I’m a born gambler who can’t resist taking a risk for a potential payoff. 5 I lie about almost everything, even when there’s no good reason to. 6 Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice. 7 I keep multiple holy symbols on me and invoke whatever deity might come in useful at any given moment. 8 I pocket anything I see that might have some value. d6 Ideal 1 Independence. I am a free spirit—no one tells me what to do. (Chaotic) 2 Fairness. I never target people who can’t afford to lose a few coins. (Lawful) 3 Charity. I distribute the money I acquire to the people who really need it. (Good) 4 Creativity. I never run the same con twice. (Chaotic) 5 Friendship. Material goods come and go. Bonds of friendship last forever. (Good) 6 Aspiration. I’m determined to make something of myself. (Any) d6 Bond 1 I fleeced the wrong person and must work to ensure that this individual never crosses paths with me or those I care about. 2 I owe everything to my mentor—a horrible person who’s probably rotting in jail somewhere. 3 Somewhere out there, I have a child who doesn’t know me. I’m making the world better for him or her. 4 I come from a noble family, and one day I’ll reclaim my lands and title from those who stole them from me. 5 A powerful person killed someone I love. Some day soon, I’ll have my revenge. 6 I swindled and ruined a person who didn’t deserve it. I seek to atone for my misdeeds but might never be able to forgive myself. d6 Flaw 1 I can’t resist a pretty face. 2 I’m always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in. 3 I’m convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others. 4 I’m too greedy for my own good. I can’t resist taking a risk if there’s money involved. 5 I can’t resist swindling people who are more powerful than me. 6 I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I’ll run and preserve my own hide if the going gets tough.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Player's Handbook"},{"name":"Charlatan","description":"Ability Scores Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma Feat Skilled Skill Proficiencies Deception and Sleight of Hand Tool Proficiency Forgery Kit Equipment Choose A or B: (A) Forgery Kit, Costume, Fine Clothes, 15 GP; or (B) 50 GP Once you were old enough to order an ale, you soon had a favorite stool in every tavern within ten miles of where you were born.

Change will only come if the oppressed come together to resist. Your work may happen out in the open or perhaps in secret. Work with the GM to decide what form your activism takes. Maybe you lead a coalition that lobbies elected officials or nobles for a change in local law. Perhaps you organize jobs, medical care, and food for those who need it. You could lead demonstrations and engage in civil disobedience, distribute literature or tag walls in the city with graffiti that calls attention to unfair taxation, break people out of jail, or redistribute wealth.

Some city dwellers love the press of bodies, the clamor of the marketplace, and the cacophony of conversation, debate, and rumormongering. Others only see humanity packed into boxes; the stink of blood, sweat, and tears; and rampant crime. The prospect of wealth in cities draws a steady supply of labor but also spurs on the abuse and marginalization of that labor. Folk stories warn of the decadence and immorality of the cities—and only some of these are false. Nevertheless, as industry grows, merchants, scholars, thieves, soldiers, sailors, and laborers continue to flock to cities to mingle, work, and trade. To city folk, their home brings to them commerce and fresh ideas from across Rokugan and the rest of the world. This eclectic and exciting environment may foster the spread of new philosophies, which can lead to conflict between different classes of society. Change comes slowly to Rokugan, but the cities usually spark that change. The sedate, seasonal pace of the farmlands shifts to one of daily hubbub in urban settings. For agrarian people, those who live in the cities appear as bizarre and perplexing as any spirit. Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, choose one other Dexterity-based skill (Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth). Tool Proficiencies: Any one tool, vehicles (ground). Languages: You can read, sign, speak, and write Rokugani and one other common language of your choice. Equipment: Resplendent regalia or unremarkable garb, club or dagger, any one tool, and 2 gp. Suggested Feats: Artisan’s Ingenuity, Fashionable, Merchant’s Streetwise. Background Feature: Worldly Wisdom As a resident of a particular region, you have the following benefits: You have a general awareness of the political climate within your place of origin. You can name major families, prominent merchants, and other leaders in the region as well as their respective positions and allegiances. You know the layout and local residents in the neighborhood where you grew up or where you live now, along with any unusual features, shortcuts, or hidden wonders in your home region. You have knowledge of the impact of crime, poverty, or political unrest that you have experienced in your homeland. You know the trade that you grew up around extremely well, even if you do not practice it yourself. This might be woodcraft, hunting, or fishing in a rural village, commerce or artisanry in a bustling city, agriculture in a farming town, or sailing in a seaside port, to name only a few examples. You can always figure out where to go to get work when in your home region or a similar area.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":26129},"publisher":"Edge Studio","book":"Adventures in Rokugan"},{"name":"City Watch","description":"You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime. You aren’t a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe. You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard.

For years you labored under a dwarf master of the craft, enduring long hours and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to gain the fine skills you possess today. You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily—particularly in the North, the shield dwarf clans learned long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned for their egos than their craft turn away promising apprentices, even those of other races. If you aren’t a dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for non-dwarves to pass on the skills of Moradin’s favored children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential apprentices who came with your recommendation. Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools Languages: Dwarvish or one other of your choice if you already speak Dwarvish Equipment: A set of artisan’s tools with which you are proficient, a maker’s mark chisel used to mark your handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you learned your skill from, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 5 gp and a gem worth 10 gp Feature: Respect of the Stout Folk As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You always have free room and board in any place where shield dwarves or gold dwarves dwell, and the individuals in such a settlement might vie among themselves to determine who can offer you (and possibly your compatriots) the finest accommodations and assistance. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a clan crafter. (For instance, consider the words “guild” and “clan” to be interchangeable.) Your bond is almost certainly related to the master or the clan that taught you, or else to the work that you produce. Your ideal might have to do with maintaining the high quality of your work or preserving the dwarven traditions of craftsmanship.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide"},{"name":"Clasp Member","description":"Whether you grew up in the mean streets of Kymal bamboozling foolish gamblers, or spent your youth pilfering loose coin from the pockets of Emon’s many tourists, your lifestyle of deceiving-to-survive eventually drew the attention of the Clasp: a storied crime syndicate that has hideouts in every city in Tal’Dorei. In exchange for protection, a modicum of kinship, and a number of useful resources to further develop your craft as a criminal, you agreed to receive the brand of the Clasp and join their ranks. You might have spent time working the guild’s most menial assignments, wandering the alleys as a simple cutpurse and filling your pockets with silver while you waited to climb the professional ladder. Or you might be a clever actor and liar, whose skill at blending in with all facets of society has made you an indispensable spy. Perhaps your swift technique with a blade led you to become a feared assassin for the Spireling leader of a local Clasp sect. Regardless, though the threat of the law is ever looming, the advantages to having a connection to such a powerful cartel greatly outweighs your paranoia. Most of the time. Since the Clasp is an organization, its members can rise in rank by proving their worth, by making the right friends in high places, or even through blackmail and bribery. You and the Game Master can decide together how your actions affect your rank in the Clasp, and what benefits that rank grants you. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, plus your choice of Sleight of Hand or Stealth Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, forgery kit, or thieves’ tools (one of your choice) Languages: Thieves’ Cant Equipment: A set of inconspicuous common clothes, a set of tools with which you’re proficient, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: A Favor in Turn You have gained enough clout in the Clasp that you can call in a favor from your contacts whenever you’re close enough to a center of syndicate activity. A request for a favor can be no longer than 20 words, and is passed up the chain to an undisclosed Spireling for approval. This favor can take on any form subject to the approval of the GM, who decides how it is fulfilled. If muscle is requested, an NPC member of the Clasp (using statistics found in chapter 6) can temporarily aid your party. If money is needed, a small loan can be provided. If you’ve been imprisoned, Clasp operatives can look into breaking you out or paying off the jailer. At some point, the favor will be called in for repayment, often without warning. Refusing the call will result in your termination—literally. You might be called on to commit a specific burglary, or to pressure an Emonian dignitary to reveal a secret at an upcoming ball. The Clasp might even demand that you assassinate a specific person, with no questions asked or answered. It’s the GM’s prerogative to ensure that the syndicate’s request is proportionate to the favor they bestowed—or that they compensate you in other ways for a service that goes beyond the scope of repaying the initial favor. Variant: Myriad Operative Your skill set might be similar to that of many members of the Clasp, but you work for a criminal organization that is far more sophisticated—and even less scrupulous. As a Myriad operative in Tal’Dorei, you might have been given a specific task that furthers that syndicate’s hunger to expand beyond Wildemount, or which gives them an edge in their rivalry with the Clasp. Moreover, you understand the wisdom of keeping your activities secret from fellow criminals as well as law enforcement, since the agents of the Clasp will show you no mercy if your true identity is ever revealed. Suggested Characteristics The Clasp enjoys a strange status in Tal’Dorei. The syndicate is a feared group of thieves and killers, whose name is often invoked only in whispers. But at the same time, the organization has a reputation for guerilla heroism, in response to its members having saved countless lives when the Chroma Conclave attacked Emon. And so like every Clasp member, your own reputation often swings between these two poles. Your bond is likely associated with your fellow Clasp members or the individual who introduced you to the syndicate. Your ideal probably involves establishing your importance and indispensability to the Clasp. Clasp Member Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 What’s life without risk? I’m always willing to take a risk if the reward seems worth it. 2 I only show my emotions around people I really trust. 3 I don’t need friends; I need allies. When I do make “friends,” I only consider what they can do for me. 4 I look for simple solutions. The world’s full of tough problems, but a well-placed knife is a one-size-fits-all answer. 5 Money talks. I don’t. We’ve got an efficient relationship. 6 I used to have one rule—don’t get involved in other people’s problems. Why are things so complicated now? 7 Crime is a game, and I play to win. I have no sympathy for players who don’t get that. 8 This organization has a lot of folks who cling to ugly, brutal practices. I’m not like that. I’m a professional, and professionals have standards. Clasp Member Ideals d6 Ideal 1 By Any Means. I complete jobs. Collateral damage isn’t my problem. (Chaotic) 2 Ambition. I will climb to the top of the ladder. Everything I do is a stepping-stone to a Spireling’s position. (Neutral) 3 Decisiveness. It’s important to make up your mind so you can act swiftly and without delay. (Neutral) 4 Honor. There’s room in the Clasp for both good and evil. Every day, I awake and choose to do what’s right. (Good) 5 Family. The Clasp is family. Anything that’s good for the family is good for me. (Lawful) 6 Self-Interest. There are too many bleeding hearts in the Clasp these days. Doing the right thing means doing the thing that makes my life better. (Evil) Clasp Member Bonds d6 Bond 1 I’d do anything—anything—to protect my comrades. 2 I’ll always be grateful to the Spireling who took me in when I was an orphaned kid. 3 I was inspired to join the Clasp by the stories my parents told of being saved from the Chroma Conclave’s attack on Emon. I can look past the organization’s flaws. 4 I was nearly killed by the Myriad. If the Clasp is the enemy of those villains, then the Clasp is my friend. 5 I’ve got family back in the old town who are counting on me for money. They don’t know how I get it, but they don’t need to know. 6 I joined the Clasp to become rich, powerful, and beloved. That’s all there is to it. Clasp Member Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I’m hopeless at organizing my belongings, and I’m always losing things. 2 I get bored whenever a plan is going too smoothly. A win is always more fun when it’s by the skin of my teeth! 3 I’ve seen Spirelings walk out among cheering crowds of thousands. Gods, I wish that were me. I need that to be me. 4 I’m rubbish with money, and never seem to leave town with a full purse. Keeps me coming back to the life, I suppose. 5 I can’t work with shoddy, makeshift thieves’ tools. I need everything involving my work to be perfect. 6 Any slight against me, no matter how small, is cause for revenge.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Darrington Press","book":"Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn"},{"name":"Cloistered Scholar","description":"As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, you found your way to one of Faerûn’s great institutes of learning , where you were apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home—not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge. The most well known of Faerûn’s fonts of knowledge is Candlekeep. The great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of Candlekeep’s own, dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world.

This may have led them to have a crisis of faith or to seek forgiveness. d8 Personality Trait 1 I am never fazed by the depths of evil I witness in my travels of the world. 2 I see those that have always worked against the shadow as naive. 3 I see good in even the darkest of shadows. 4 I treat the weakest of my enemies without mercy. 5 I am slow to trust. 6 I am at risk of exposing myself as a previous agent of the shadow because I find it difficult not to impress others with my knowledge of the enemy. 7 I keep a low profile so as not to draw unwanted attention. 8 I keep my body and clothing fastidious as though it cleansed me of past deeds. d6 Ideal 1 Pragmatism. The ends justify the means. (Evil) 2 Remorse. I've committed such evil that I will never make up for what I've done. (Lawful) 3 Redemption. I still have a chance to right the wrongs I've committed in my past. (Good) 4 Freedom. My commitment to my own freedom means more to me than anything else. (Chaotic) 5 Stoicism. I weather hardship and pain with silence and resolve. (Neutral) 6 Thankfulness. Others showed me the error of my ways and I intend to pass that gift forward. (Good) d6 Bond 1 My devotion to my loved ones is strong enough that I will do anything for them, even commit murder. 2 I owe a favor to a legate from my days working under Izrador. 3 I wronged a family in the past, and my guilt has grown over the years. I want to make amends. 4 An aspect of my old life serving the Shadow still entices me. 5 I know that someone seeks vengeance against me for an atrocity I was once a part of. 6 Though I no longer follow Izrador, I miss the rituals of worship and sometimes catch myself whispering prayers and incantations again out of habit. d6 Flaw 1 In my heart of hearts, I'm unsure of my decision to betray Izrador and may go back to my old ways if the temptation becomes too great. 2 I'm likely to betray my friends if given an opportunity to be in a position of great power. 3 I've developed such a taste of violence that I sometimes encourage it. 4 When things look bad, my companions shouldn't expect me to stick around. 5 Another person faced justice for my crimes, and that's perfectly alright with me. 6 I'm willing to change my position on a matter just to be the one who wins the argument.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Edge Studio","book":"Midnight - Crown of Shadow"},{"name":"Cometborn","description":"Cometborn are individuals born under the passing of a comet. The event magically changed them, instilling in them memories from before they were born. These memories are fragments of various events and people that existed in the world in some of the previous times the comet passed overhead. Cometborn are aware these memories are not their own but find comfort in the memories nonetheless. They often turn to these memories in times of stress or uncertainty, seeking—and often finding—answers to their current plight. This connection to the past makes cometborn seem “wise beyond their years” and leads many to lives of historical study or to advisory roles among their peers. This connection also gives cometborn an innate sense of people, able to read others and easily detect patterns in behavior. Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools or one type of musical instrument Languages: Primordial and one other language of your choice Equipment: A shard from a meteorite or other cosmic object, a set of artisan’s tools or a musical instrument (one of your choice), a set of common clothes, and a pouch with 5 gp Feature: Fragments of the Past Memories of the past fill your mind, always within easy reach should you need them. Whenever you face a difficult decision or great uncertainty, you can look to these memories for an answer. The answer might come in short flashes or glimpses into a similar situation viewed or experienced by someone in the past, but the answer is never a clear direction for the decision you must make. The memories provide you with a sensation of hope, foreboding, tranquility, despair, joy, indifference, or similar emotion around your planned course of action, hinting that the plan might lead to positive, negative, positive and negative, or neutral results. You can consult your ancient memories in this way no more than once every 24 hours. Suggested Characteristics The memory fragments in the cometborn’s mind often leave them feeling apart from those around them, as they know and understand things they shouldn’t or that others take years to learn. As a result, some cometborn tend toward being charismatic and gregarious, overcompensating for any awkwardness they feel they might exhibit, while others become paranoid and reclusive, shutting themselves off from others to avoid being hurt. d8 Personality Trait 1 I am outgoing and charming. I always know just what you need to hear. 2 I worry those around me will see I am somehow different. 3 I plot and plan incessantly, past memories of a tragedy that befell unprepared people haunting me. 4 I am prone to feeling sentimental and wistful at inopportune times. 5 I am obsessed with the stars and heavenly bodies. I sometimes forgo sleep to watch the night sky. 6 I only speak when necessary. My words are calculated. 7 I am secretive about both meaningful and mundane things. 8 I cannot shake the feeling of being an outsider, even when surrounded by sincere friends and loving family. d6 Ideal 1 Knowledge. Learning and gaining knowledge is always useful. Gathering information is its own reward. (Any) 2 Secrets. I love learning and keeping secrets. You can trust me with anything. (Any) 3 Connection. We so rarely see one another for who we are. We should treasure those who are trustworthy. (Good) 4 Truth. The greatest gift you can receive is the truth. The challenge is to know who is worthy. (Lawful) 5 Control. I love using my talents to manipulate others. I derive joy from controlling those around me. (Evil) 6 Deception. No armor protects like a thick pack of lies. (Chaotic) d6 Bond 1 I will learn the truth about some past event hinted at in my memories and what it means. 2 I will find others who are like me. 3 I will obtain the secrets of powerful figures and use them to my advantage. 4 One day, I will return home and tell my family the truth about my ancient memories. 5 I will find the astronomer who visited me as a child—they knew I was cometborn. 6 I will travel the stars and find the comet that crossed my birth. When I do, I will destroy it. d6 Flaw 1 I make friends slowly and struggle to trust them. 2 I often lie about inconsequential things. 3 I sometimes drive people away by overanalyzing their motivations and behaviors. 4 A lifetime of seeing, hearing, and feeling fragments of memories of others has left me unsure who I really am. This often results in inconsistent behavior and choices. 5 My ability to read people leads me to treat relationships like games. 6 Every so often, I leave everything behind and start anew.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Deep Magic Vol 2"},{"name":"Commercial Pilot","description":"For every ace fighter pilot or sky pirate, there are hundreds of completely unremarkable civilian pilots, who make their livings ferrying goods, people, and information between the stars. These commercial pilots may not have much combat experience, but they do spend a large portion of their lives at the controls, and surely know their ships better than anyone else. There are many reasons why a civilian pilot might become an adventurer. It is not uncommon for trained pilots to be dragooned into service in military fleets during times of crisis; likewise, pilots are often asked to step up to protect their ships, crews, and cargos from the many dangers of space. Some pilots enter the profession fully expecting a life of adventure, looking forward to the opportunities they will have to travel and explore. Skill Proficiencies: Perception, Piloting Tool Proficiencies: Ship maintenance tools Languages: Any one of your choice Equipment: A partial map of a distant star system, a badge or insignia from your flying school, a pair of aviator glasses, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Take-off Checklist Your many hours of flying experience mean that all the standard checks and preparations involved in launching or docking a ship are firmly ingrained into your mind. Any simple maneuvers you undertake while piloting a ship go much quicker and smoother, with no risk of mishap. Previous Ships When you choose the pilot background, you should consider what sorts of ships you have flown in the past, and perhaps think of names for some of them.

That doesn’t tell the whole story, however, and there are some traits that speak to the unique culture and lifestyles of interplanetary aircrew. d8 Personality Trait 1 I fly by the seat of my pants. 2 I always keep a photograph of my family in the cockpit. 3 I prefer to be in control of my own destiny, rather than in someone else’s hands. 4 I live fast! 5 Multitasking is no problem for me. 6 I have very steady hands. 7 I can recognize a ship a mile away just from its movements. 8 I don’t feel entirely comfortable on dry land. d6 Ideal 1 Freedom.

Your intuition is amazing, and you’ve often identified a villain after a single look at the person. And when trouble is on the horizon, you know it’s not just a weather change. As things went downhill on Virthys, you knew what was coming. Or, well, at least that something was coming. You tried to warn people, but they just laughed at you. Only when people actually started to die, people began to believe you might have been up to something. If only people had listened to you, maybe something could have been done. Maybe the end of the world could have been stopped. It’s a miracle that anybody survived, that there's still a little piece of the old world left. You are not going to watch again. This time, you will not only be vigilant. You will fight evil before it can ever get that far again. Skill Proficiencies: Choose two of the following: Perception, Insight or Investigation Tool Proficiencies and Languages: Choose two of the following: Disguise Kit, Thieves Tools or an obscure language not known by common people. The language can be one usually not accessible to outsiders, like Druidic or Thieves’ Cant, or it can be from other planes or worlds. Equipment: A pouch containing 5 gp A set of commoner's clothes A scholar's pack A notebook from your life on Virthys, filled with clues that pointed early to the coming apocalypse. Pattern Recognition: You are skilled at seeing patterns - sometimes even when there isn't one. Once a day, whenever you are out of ideas, or simply looking for a fresh take on something, you can ask the GM to roll for Investigation for your character. The DC is set for each individual roll by the GM. If you succeed, the GM gives you a new clue - it might be a very minor detail, or a major aspect of your current adventure. In any case, it should be something your character wasn't aware of yet, possibly even some seemingly far-fetched idea that happens to be correct. If the check fails, the GM still gives you a clue, but it connects two things that are in reality unconnected. It is impossible for you to discern whether the check was successful or a failure; your character is convinced that the clue is correct, until proven wrong (and sometimes even after proven wrong). Suggested characteristics: The truth is out there, and you are going to uncover it. Some might call you a madman, but you've experienced that before. You are extremely resilient (some say bullheaded) when it comes to doubt. Truth is, you consider your blind spots to be focusing lenses. But you love connecting the dots - either for the intellectual challenge, to feel elitist or because you truly believe in the hidden dangers, and want to protect the world from it. Most probably, it's a combination of these things. Traits I believe that no powerful people can be trusted, and they all try to manipulate the masses. I am a believer. The world out there is far weirder and more obscure than most people would ever dare to think. I keep my friends close, because I know I won't be able to defeat the powers-that-be on my own. I see patterns everywhere. Sometimes, my mind is so flooded by this that I need to write things down to calm myself. I always keep an eye out for the great dangers - to me and to the entire world. I'm stubborn. Once I'm convinced of something, it is really hard to convince me otherwise. I love the thrill of following clues and uncovering hidden secrets. I have little respect for privacy. All secrets are bad, even those of a personal nature. Ideals Truth. The people need to know what is going on so they can make the right decisions. (Good) Laws and rules. Even the powerful have to bow before the laws of society. (Lawful) Freedom. No laws will keep me from uncovering the truth. (Chaotic) Manipulation. Knowledge is power. Even made-up knowledge. (Evil) Loyalty. You will fight on the side of your friends, and of everyone else who seeks the truth, no matter which powers stand against you. (Neutral) Knowledge. Seeking the truth is a value in itself. (Any) Bonds Before the apocalypse, I found a clue to something that is still relevant in the new world. I'm going to find what's behind this, no matter how long it will take. In the old world, I had a mentor that showed me how to find the truth behind lies. I found out this person is still alive, but I have no idea where to find them. I know one of the people or creatures that were at least partially responsible for what happened during the apocalypse. I won't stop pursuing them and bringing them to justice. There was one person in particular that believed me before the world ended. They didn't make it, but I made a promise to them, and I intend to keep that promise. I've seen the world die. I will not allow that a second time. I will protect this world and all its inhabitants, no matter the dangers before me. I have a secret contact that I know nothing about. All I get is letters or hidden clues, always with some kind of telltale sign that it's from the same person. I am still not sure whether I can trust that person. Flaws I mistrust everyone at first. People can earn my trust, but it takes time, and it can be lost quickly. I tend to over-interpret things. I'm hypervigilant, and I often consider possible signs of danger as fact. I'm reckless. The powers-that-be can't be toppled by the faint of heart. I'm ruthless. Sacrificing others for the greater goal just has to be done sometimes. I'm convinced that I'm better than others. I see things that others are too stupid or uninformed to understand. Which is why I cling to my theories, because they have to be right for me to be as elitist as I feel. I believe those who ignore the clues that I show them deserve whatever's coming to them. It's not my job to save anyone who's too ignorant to understand.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Continental Nobility","description":"Continental Nobility Requirements: Any class except sorcerer, warlock, or wizard You are the scion of a noble household.

Defining Event (1d8) 1 I was well celebrated in my city as a slayer of a great troll. 2 I witnessed the death of my family during the civil war. They were targets for their ties to the von Kessel name. 3 I led my knights to victory in defending our castle during a raid in the war. 4 I lost a lot of good soldiers in an earlier expedition into Drakkenheim. We never made it past the gate. 5 My house was an enemy of the von Kessel family and had many battles with them. 6 I broke ties with my family when they folded to the Silver Order. 7 I am related, not to a king or queen, but to a noble figure who sat in the small council and made important decisions for their represented house. 8 My family lost everything in the destruction of Drakkenheim. We are noble only in name, no longer in standing. Personality Trait (1d8) 1 I consider myself a renowned monster slayer, and like to remind everyone of the many accomplishments I hold to my name. 2 I keep family traditions close. Honour and family are amongst the most important things in the world, and I cherish them. 3 I miss the comforts of my home. This city is dirty and smells terrible. 4 I believe in the good in people, and I hope to find a peaceful resolution to our problems. A diplomatic approach is something Westemär greatly needs. 5 As a noble, I have a responsibility to protect those who cannot protect themselves. 6 It is highly important that I look my best and maintain my regal demeanor in all situations.

It is my responsibility as a representative of my noble line to remain cordial, and diplomatic in dealings with the various high ranking members of Drakkenheim’s society. (Good) 3 Privacy. I do not wish for my nobility to come up. It may be best if the people of Drakkenheim do not know who I am. At least for now. (Any) 4 Duty. It is my duty to aid the people of Drakkenheim. As a noble I was connected to this city, and it is what is expected of me. (Good) 5 Glory. I must claim my victories and prove myself in battle. (Any) 6 Family. Blood is thicker than water and I will fight to defend my family’s honour.

Drakkenheim may be our last chance to get it back. 4 My family was betrayed by one of the royal houses, and I plan to make sure any that remain of that name are brought to justice and my family takes its place where it belongs. 5 I am destined to rule, as my ancestors before me have. 6 I have been sent unwillingly on a diplomatic mission to Drakkenheim. I am to gain political standing in these crumbling ruins. Flaw (1d6) 1 I boast about my own triumphs, and belittle the accomplishments of others. 2 Bound by honor, I can never back down from a challenge, nor can I let those who undervalue my name go unchallenged. 3 I do not like getting my hands dirty. Other people must do the heavy lifting, not me. 4 I like to flaunt my wealth, and I spare no expense. 5 I’m never wrong.

A trickster lord of the Path of Mischief (or Illusion), if asked about their court’s philosophy, would say that humans, alone among animals, have rebelled against the duty of all creatures to see one another as equals. Humans exalt themselves above others by virtue of the advantages granted to them by their bodies and minds, and they reshape the world around them into something it was not before. The Celestial Order, as the philosophy of the opposing court would have one believe, appears to aid and abet humans in this pursuit, presenting human life as a reward for a good animal life, and punishes humans little for their hubris and selfishness. The Path of Mischief (or Illusion)'s beings take redressing these wrongs into their own claws, and many seek to weaken humanity and tilt the scales of the world back to how it was it was before humanity’s age of ascendency.

You are an expert in complex social dynamics and knowledgeable in the history and customs of courtly life. Work with your GM to determine whom you served and why you are no longer a servant: did your master or masters retire and no longer require servants, did you resign from the service of a harsh master, did the court you served fall to a neighboring empire, or did something else happen? Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight Tool Proficiencies: One artisan’s tools set of your choice Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of artisan’s tools of your choice, a unique piece of jewelry, a set of fine clothes, a handcrafted pipe, and a belt pouch containing 20 gp Feature: Servant’s Invisibility The art of excellent service requires a balance struck between being always available and yet unobtrusive, and you’ve mastered it. If you don’t perform a visible action, speak or be spoken to, or otherwise have attention drawn to you for at least 1 minute, creatures nearby have trouble remembering you are even in the room. Until you speak, perform a visible action, or have someone draw attention to you, creatures must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC equal to 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus) to notice you. Otherwise, they conduct themselves as though you aren’t present until either attention is drawn to you or one of their actions would take them into or within 5 feet of the space you occupy. Suggested Characteristics Court servants tend to be outwardly quiet and soft-spoken, but their insight into the nuances of conversation and societal happenings is unparalleled. When in crowds or around strangers, most court servants keep to themselves, quietly observing their surroundings and later sharing such observations with those they trust. d8 Personality Trait 1 Unless I must speak, I hold my breath while serving others. 2 It takes all my effort not to show the effusive emotions I feel when I help others. Best to quietly serve. 3 It’s getting harder to tolerate the prejudices of those I serve daily. 4 Though the old ways are hard to give up, I want to be my own boss. I’ll decide my path. 5 Serving my family and friends is the only thing I truly care about. 6 City life is killing my soul. I long for the old courtly ways. 7 It’s time for my fellows to wake up and be taken advantage of no longer. 8 It’s the small things that make it all worthwhile. I try to be present in every moment. d6 Ideal 1 Family. My family, whether the one I come from or the one I make, is the thing in this world most worth protecting. (Any) 2 Service. I am most rewarded when I know I have performed a valuable service for another. (Good) 3 Sloth. What’s the point of helping anyone now that I’ve been discarded? (Chaotic) 4 Compassion. I can’t resist helping anyone in need. (Good) 5 Tradition. Life under my master’s rule was best, and things should be kept as close to their ideals as possible. (Lawful) 6 Joy. The pursuit of happiness is the only thing worth serving anymore. (Neutral) d6 Bond 1 My family needs me to provide for them. They mean everything to me, which means I’ll do whatever it takes. 2 My kin have served this holding and its lords and ladies for generations. I serve them faithfully to make my lineage proud. 3 I can’t read the inscriptions on this odd ring, but it’s all I have left of my family and our history of loyal service. 4 I’m with the best friends a person can ask for, so why do I feel so lonesome and homesick? 5 I’ve found a profession where my skills are put to good use, and I won’t let anyone bring me down. 6 I found peace in a special garden filled with beautiful life, but I only have this flower to remind me. Someday I’ll remember where to find that garden. d6 Flaw 1 I would rather serve darkness than serve no one. 2 I’m afraid of taking risks that might be good for me. 3 I believe my master’s people are superior to all others, and I’m not afraid to share that truth. 4 I always do as I’m told, even though sometimes I don’t think I should. 5 I know what’s best for everyone, and they’d all be better off if they’d follow my advice. 6 I can’t stand seeing ugly or depressing things. I’d much rather think happy thoughts. Desert Runner You grew up in the desert. As a nomad, you moved from place to place, following the caravan trails. Your upbringing makes you more than just accustomed to desert living—you thrive there. Your family has lived in the desert for centuries, and you know more about desert survival than life in the towns and cities. Skill Proficiencies: Perception, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Herbalist kit Languages: One of your choice Equipment: Traveler’s clothes, herbalist kit, waterskin, pouch with 10 gp Feature: Nomad Living in the open desert has allowed your body to adapt to a range of environmental conditions. You can survive on 1 gallon of water in hot conditions (or 1⁄2 gallon in normal conditions) without being forced to make Constitution saving throws, and you are considered naturally adapted to hot climates. While in a desert, you can read the environment to predict natural weather patterns and temperatures for the next 24 hours, allowing you to cross dangerous terrain at the best times. The accuracy of your predictions is up to the GM, but they should be reliable unless affected by magic or unforeseeable events, such as distant earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Suggested Characteristics Those raised in the desert can be the friendliest of humanoids—knowing allies are better than enemies in that harsh environment—or territorial and warlike, believing that protecting food and water sources by force is the only way to survive. d8 Personality Trait 1 I’m much happier sleeping under the stars than in a bed in a stuffy caravanserai. 2 It’s always best to help a traveler in need; one day it might be you. 3 I am slow to trust strangers, but I’m extremely loyal to my friends. 4 If there’s a camel race, I’m the first to saddle up! 5 I always have a tale or poem to share at the campfire. 6 I don’t like sleeping in the same place more than two nights in a row. 7 I’ve been troubled by strange dreams for the last month. I am determined to uncover their meaning. 8 I feel lonelier in a crowded city than I do out on the empty desert sands. d6 Ideal 1 Greater Good. The needs of the whole tribe outweigh those of the individuals who are part of it. (Good) 2 Nature. I must do what I can to protect the beautiful wilderness from those who would do it harm. (Neutral) 3 Tradition. I am duty-bound to follow my tribe’s age-old route through the desert. (Lawful) 4 Change. Things seldom stay the same and we must always be prepared to go with the flow. (Chaotic) 5 Honor. If I behave dishonorably, my actions will bring shame upon the entire tribe. (Lawful) 6 Greed. Seize what you want if no one gives it to you freely. (Evil) d6 Bond 1 I am the last living member of my tribe, and I cannot let their deaths go unavenged. 2 I follow the spiritual path of my tribe; it will bring me to the best afterlife when the time comes. 3 My best friend has been sold into slavery to devils, and I need to rescue them before it is too late. 4 A nature spirit saved my life when I was dying of thirst in the desert. 5 My takoba sword is my most prized possession; for over two centuries, it’s been handed down from generation to generation. 6 I have sworn revenge on the sheikh who unjustly banished me from the tribe. d6 Flaw 1 I enjoy the company of camels more than people. 2 I can be loud and boorish after a few wineskins. 3 If I feel insulted, I’ll refuse to speak to anyone for several hours. 4 I enjoy violence and mayhem a bit too much. 5 You can’t rely on me in a crisis. 6 I betrayed my brother to cultists to save my own skin.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Tome of Heroes"},{"name":"Courtier","description":"In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organization.

D6 Reason For Joining 1 Stumbling upon a cultish ritual, I witnessed the dark powers they possessed and I wanted them as well. 2 I swore revenge on the one who murdered my family, the cult will help me find and kill them in exchange for my devotion. 3 I was raised by the leader of a cult and plan on making them proud by following in their footsteps. 4 I was an outcast because of my odd looks or strange behaviors, the cult took me in and accepted me as if I were family. 5 The unjust death of a loved one has me determined to bring them back and with the knowledge this cult possesses, I believe I can do so. 6 I discovered an ancient relic that awoke something powerful within me and it wants me to release it unto the world. Feature: Lore of the Occult Cult members are expected to study and practice the beliefs and rituals of the dark masters they’ve devoted themselves to. Experienced in studying occult lore, you can easily recall information on cultist activities and rituals you have experienced. If you’re unable to recall this information, you most likely know where, or who, you can obtain it from. Whether from a book, a person, or a place, it could be dangerous to seek out and your current standing with your cult may or may not affect your ability to obtain it. Your time amongst the cult has also made it easy for you to recognize signs of cultish activity or behavior. This could be recognizing an odd speech pattern someone uses when communicating or spotting occult iconography or text, or other signs of a similar nature. Option: I Got Away From a Cult… Most aren’t lucky enough to get out once they’ve been inducted, but you did. When did you realize you needed to get out or die trying. D6 Reason For Leaving 1 After participating in a sacrificial ritual, I knew I was in over my head and needed to escape. 2 When I was asked to burn down an orphanage, I decided there were some lines I couldn’t cross. 3 After years of devoted service, I discovered the order I was devoted to was responsible for the deaths of my family. 4 I was betrayed by my cult, they performed a ritual to manifest a dark entity within me, I escaped seeking someone to destroy it. 5 I was kidnapped by the cult and escaped after finding out they wanted to kill me. I’ve been on the run ever since. 6 Upon discovering the cult planned on bringing about the apocalypse, I tried to find others to help me stop them. Suggested Characteristics Cultists may be skittish, paranoid, or jump to conclusions that may normally seem illogical where it comes to topics close to the activities of their cult. D8 Personality Traits 1 I’m always on the lookout for signs or omens from my dark lord. 2 I have an overly pessimistic attitude towards anything other than my devotions. 3 I’ve been chosen by an entity of ancient evil to do its bidding. 4 Always on edge from a lifetime of betrayal, I never let my guard down. 5 Having spent so long only around other followers I am paranoid around strangers. 6 I blindly took to the teachings of our leader. Now that I’ve left I question everything. 7 I never miss an opportunity to warn others of the evils that I escaped. 8 Once I was considered one of the most prestigious members of our order. I will not be disrespected. D6 Ideals 1 Devotion - Nothing is more important than the will of our dark lord. (Lawful) 2 Sacrifice – We must all do our part, no matter how costly the price. (Chaotic) 3 Atonement – I did horrible things in their name and now I work to right those wrongs. (Neutral) 4 Ambition – When our dark lord rises, we shall take our rightful place by their side and reign together. (Evil) 5 Salvation – To cleanse my soul of the deeds I committed in their name, I have dedicated my life to purging their evil. (Good) 6 Teamwork – Alone we are but one part of a machine, together we are strong enough to take on anything. (Any) D6 Bonds 1 The relationships I formed in the order taught me the value of family. 2 I won’t ever forget the first ritual sacrifice I participated in. 3 Our cult leader saved my life when I was a young child, but I know he must be stopped. 4 The ancient knowledge I helped protect would plunge the world into madness should it become known. 5 The order had a strict and consistent daily regiment which helped keep me sane.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":28072},"publisher":"Lone Colossus Games","book":"Injuries and Vile Deeds"},{"name":"Curio Collector","description":"Curio collectors are obsessed with collecting alchemical ingredients, spell components, and other small oddities. They travel the world in search of the rarest of these to add to their collections. Not all curio collectors are spellcasters, though many are. They might be caring and generous community leaders who want to facilitate magic in their community or quiet and withdrawn owners of a curio shop stuffed with oddities both practical and decorative. The curio collector is always proud of their collections and is usually willing to show and maybe even share with those who take an interest.

You immediately recognize when an object you perceive or handle is an ingredient or component for something, though you might not recall its exact application without further study. You also have a general idea of its value in the markets where it would be most desired, estimating a value within 15 percent of the object’s actual value in those markets. Suggested Characteristics Curio collectors are obsessive, detail-oriented individuals who are highly motivated to complete their collections. They enjoy the hunt for rare ingredients and components and take great care to maintain the object’s quality when collecting it.

Members of the lodge—known as guides—are a rough and tumble lot. As a dancing bear guide, you are at home in the wilds of Midgard, but you make forays into civilization for the express purpose of exposing city-dwellers to the freedom of the wilds. Closed-off streets strewn with garbage and filth mask the truth the wider world has to offer. You’ll show them what they’ve forgotten, and when they see, they’ll understand. Wilderness guides, trappers, teamsters, and smugglers, the guides take any job that involves dragging civilized folk through the brambles to expand their horizons. Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, Survival Tool Proficiencies: vehicles (land) Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of traveler’s clothes, a map of the region around your home marked with shortcuts and secluded hideaways, a hunting trap, and a pouch containing 10 gp.

You can pass freely through city gates where travelers are typically scrutinized or taxed, and you can cross disputed land or through the territory of warring tribes without harassment by making your affiliation known; no one wants to alienate the guides without a compelling reason. You lose this consideration in a given city if you earn a reputation there as a criminal or as a trouble-maker, at the GM’s discretion. Suggested Characteristics Dancing bear guides might appear gruff and unapproachable when they're in towns, but that has more to do with their discomfort in urban settings than with their personalities. In the wilderness they love, most dancing bear guides are personable and friendly, and they even have an endearing if rough sense of humor. They'll form connections with anyone who displays a love for the wilderness or a sincere desire to learn its ways. Guides offer their services readily. d8 Personality Traits 1 Gates are meant to keep city folk in, not keep me out. 2 I enjoy the discomfort of fancy folk when they slog through the mud. 3 No trails, no problem! 4 My clothes are stained and my hair is tangled, but I’m well-spoken and polite. 5 No sense getting bent out of shape when things don’t go your way; it’s better to laugh at misfortune and then show it who’s boss. 6 I tolerate cities, but I thrive in the wild. 7 I don't waste nature’s bounty, and I dislike those who do. 8 I use few words.

Unless it's whatever I ate earlier. I never could understand all that gurgling. — Xanathar You died and came back. This experience changed you and defines who you are today. The specifics of your death are up to you, but the following questions and suggestions will help you determine your odd personal history. How did you die? It probably wasn't of old age. Spells like raise dead can bring back those who die before old age takes them, but after dying of old age there is almost no magic which can bring a person back to life. Was it combat? An accident? A disease? How long were you dead? Spells like true resurrection allow a character to return from death after as many as 200 years. How has the world changed politically, technologically, and culturally since your death? What remains of your family, friends, and personal life? What was your life after death like? Did you spend time in the glory of eternal battle is Ysgard? Did you enjoy the paradise of Elysium? Were you tortured in the Nine Hells or Abyss? Do you remember nothing from that time? Maybe you didn't completely pass on, but lived life as an undead, such as a ghost or vampire. Why did you become such a being? What acts did you commit that you now regret? Who still thinks of you as a monster? Finally someone brought you back. Who was it, and why? Maybe it was to face an old enemy. Maybe it was a loved one who searched for a long time and sacrificed much to revive you. Maybe you were brought back for a secret only you knew. How did this person bring you back? Was it straightforward magic? What about a spell like reincarnate , which could bring your spirit back in the body of a different humanoid race?

You may spend a day of downtime communicating with the souls to learn a piece of information by asking a question. The quality and specifics of the information you get are up to the DM. Suggested Characteristics You have experienced something few living people have yet to go through. You might be the type who embraces the second chance and loves life, relishing every opportunity and letting nothing stand in your way. Or you might be quiet and brooding, thinking of the revenge you seek for your death or missing the planar heaven you left behind. People who have died often live in one of these extremes, experiencing life to the fullest or becoming fixated on a single goal that gives their new life meaning. d8 Personality Traits 1 When faced with a new experience the word \"no\" isn't in my vocabulary. 2 I always have the loudest laugh in the room. 3 When I want something, I'm direct and simple in my request. 4 The story of my demise, like all my stories, is greatly exaggerated. 5 Those who ask me about my death quickly learn to never ask again. 6 I treat most people like they're idiots.

Sometimes, there’s wealth and intrigue involved, but more often than not, there’s also obligation and responsibility. You are a person with just such a responsibility. This could involve a noble title, an arranged marriage, a family business you’re expected to administer, or an inherited civil office. You promised to fulfill this responsibility, you are desperately trying to avoid this duty, or you might even be seeking the person intended to be at your side. Regardless of the reason, you’re on the road, heading toward or away from your destiny. Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A dagger, quarterstaff, or spear, a set of traveler’s clothes, a memento of your destiny (a keepsake from your betrothed, the seal of your destined office, your family signet ring, or similar), a belt pouch containing 15 gp Destiny You’re a person who’s running from something or hurtling headfirst towards something, but just what is it? The responsibility or event might be happily anticipated or simply dreaded; either way, you’re committed to the path. Choose a destiny or roll a d8 and consult the table below. d8 Destiny 1 You are running away from a marriage. 2 You are seeking your runaway betrothed. 3 You don’t want to take over your famous family business. 4 You need to arrive at a religious site at a specific time to complete an event or prophecy. 5 Your noble relative died, and you’re required to take their vacant position. 6 You are the reincarnation of a famous figure, and you’re expected to live in an isolated temple. 7 You were supposed to serve an honorary but dangerous position in your people’s military. 8 Members of your family have occupied a civil office (court scribe, sheriff, census official, or similar) for generations. Feature: Reputation of Opportunity Your story precedes you, as does your quest to claim—or run away from—your destiny. Those in positions of power, such as nobles, bureaucrats, rich merchants, and even mercenaries and brigands, all look to either help or hinder you, based on what they think they may get out of it. They’re always willing to meet with you briefly to see just how worthwhile such aid or interference might be. This might mean a traveler pays for your passage on a ferry, a generous benefactor covers your group’s meals at a tavern, or a local governor invites your adventuring entourage to enjoy a night’s stay in their guest quarters. However, the aid often includes an implied threat or request. Some might consider delaying you as long as politely possible, some might consider taking you prisoner for ransom or to do “what’s best” for you, and others might decide to help you on your quest in exchange for some future assistance. You’re never exactly sure of the associated “cost” of the person’s aid until the moment arrives. In the meantime, the open road awaits. Suggested Characteristics Destined characters might be running toward or away from destiny, but whatever the case, their destiny has shaped them.

I seek redemption. 8 I must prove myself worthy to my faith and its purpose, no matter the amount of blood spilled or lives lost.

Mindless or simple undead such as skeletons and zombies don't recognize you for what you are, but more intelligent undead may be willing to treat instead of fight, if you approach them correctly.

Sometimes a mission’s sole purpose is to conceal the motivation behind another strike performed in a different part of the city, or simply to spread fear. As part of your covert work for House Dimir , you maintain a false identity as a member of another guild. You can choose your secondary guild or roll to determine it randomly.

Divine Guidance You have spent countless hours praying, studying scriptures, and performing rituals. Your devotion is so great that it draws the attention of the Radiant One, or so you believe. You can call upon this divine favor to guide your path. Once per day, you may ask your deity for guidance. How this guidance manifests can vary—a sudden insight, a prophetic dream, or perhaps a subtle sign in the environment around you.

And Losing Privilege Just as a lowborn character can gain a noble title, a highborn one can lose it. The simplest path to being stripped of a title is to be convicted of treason. However, in the Five Nations, nobles have duties, and a family who fails in those might be stripped of their title and property by their monarch. In the Lhazaar Principalities, a character could lose their title because someone else takes it by force. And countless Cyran nobles lost their holdings in the Mourning, then the Treaty of Thronehold effectively stripped them of their privileges. The following table provides inspiration for ways an adventurer’s family might’ve lost their title; while the table assumes an ancestor lost the title, it’s also possible the adventurer themself lost it. How Did You Lose Your Title? d6 Reason for Loss 1 Your ancestor attempted to kill the sovereign and failed. Do you know what drove them to attempt this crime? 2 Your ancestor was framed by rivals who now hold your rightful title and lands. What crime were they framed for? 3 Your domain was lost to an enemy during the Last War. Who holds it now? 4 Your ancestor worked with an enemy during the Last War and was convicted of treason. What were they trying to accomplish? 5 Your domain was abandoned after being seized by a supernatural force. Is it haunted by deadly undead or held by aberrations from Khyber? Was your ancestor responsible for this situation? 6 Your ancestor refused to uphold the laws of the land. Were they decadent, corrupt, or negligent? Or were they taking a principled stand? Should a player character be stripped of their title during a campaign, it’s up to the player and DM to decide how this affects their Position of Privilege. If the character is widely known and beloved, it’s possible the benefit lingers based solely on that goodwill. As a DM, if I removed the benefits of Position of Privilege, I'd grant a new feature to replace it, based on the circumstances of its loss. Was the noble convicted of treason because they opposed a tyrant? They might lose their Position of Privilege but gain the Rustic Hospitality feature of a folk hero … or perhaps the infamy of their deeds earns them the Bad Reputation of a pirate. The “Variant Noble: Disgraced” sidebar presents a background variant a DM could grant during a campaign, or that a player could choose for a new character who recently fell from grace. Variant Noble: Disgraced Though you’re a member of the aristocracy, your family has lost favor with its peers. The source of your disgrace might be a debt or defeat shared between all members of your house, or a particular family member might’ve been accused or convicted of heinous crimes. Feature: Scandalous Your family name and your alleged failures are known far and wide. Nobles and loyal commoners may put up a polite front as propriety demands, but they are inclined to think the worst of you. Meanwhile, there are plenty who seek to capitalize on your position. You can always seek a secret meeting with a noble who is not the current head of their house, or with a local criminal leader.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Keith Baker Presents","book":"Chronicles of Eberron"},{"name":"Displaced Noble","description":"Note: This variant modifies the Noble background from the Player's Handbook .

In situations like this, you might choose the Retainers feature instead (from the “ Variant Feature: Retainers ” sidebar in the Player’s Handbook ). Perhaps your estates were lost to the Mourning, but you still have three loyal servants who are sworn to follow you to the bitter end.

Whether it’s for cops, cartels, or corporations, in exchange for a little bit of their power and a little bit of their money, you hurt who they tell you to. The work isn’t all dubious—you’re often up against people that are at least as bad as your boss—but when your boss sends you to shake down shopkeepers or punch protesters, you follow orders. As long as you and yours are fine, you don’t care. When you choose this background, work with your GM to determine who you worked for and what kind of work they had you do.

Other enforcers, even those that work for other bosses, see you as “one of the good guys”. They will offer you shelter and loan you basic equipment, so long as doing so doesn’t put them in obvious danger. They will also overlook any crimes you commit, unless it’s particularly egregious or harms them or their bosses. Suggested Characteristics Enforcers are defined by a willingness to put the desires of their bosses ahead of their own beliefs. They tend to be loyal and efficient but also isolated and untrusting D8 Personality Trait 1 I get angry when people don’t listen to me. 2 When I’m not sleeping, eating, or fighting, I’m lifting weights or running laps. 3 I’m covered in scars and will happily recount the fights that earned each one. 4 People that can’t defend themselves disgust me, and I make no effort to hide it. 5 I struggle to make important decisions for myself. 6 It’s hard for me to trust anyone I haven’t fought alongside. 7 I don’t like being alone, especially out in the open. 8 I have an insatiable yearning for others’ respect.

Not only do all of their daily struggles concern technology, but the state of technology and thus the technological advancements in a city determine their political status as well, as both are in a race against the other in this regard. It’s no wonder that engineers are thus in high demand in Tolia. You, an engineer, have studied one of the most prestigious disciplines one could read up on. Whether you’ve graduated from an institute of higher education, had a master from whom you learnt your craft, or researched and studied everything on your own, you have rendered yourself a valuable commodity as someone who understands technology. No matter how you got started on this path, you now possess an ability most would gladly kill for in Tolia.

It is easy for you to find a job and they mostly pay well. You can easily earn 20 KF/CS in a day. Suggested Characteristics You are a creature of logic and intelligence. Whether you were shaped into this as a result of your emotions being pushed to the limits or whether you’ve never had them in the first place, you believe in facts, numbers and realities. As an engineer, it’s your job to solve problems intellectually before applying the solutions you find to a manual reality. You may be in search of more power aiding the tyrannical powers of society in their quest to make a grimmer reality, or you can be a guerilla fighter aiding your kinspeople in their struggle against injustice; but one thing is for certain: you know from mechanisms. d8 Personality Trait 1 I believe I’m better than most. 2 Any display of emotion makes me uncomfortable. 3 I talk very little, only when I think it necessary. 4 I find solace in humor. 5 I want to rise against the system, but I don’t have the guts. 6 Symmetry is very important to me; I don’t like ugly things… including people. 7 If I have a mission, I can think of nothing else until I get it done. 8 I shut down at the sight of things that are obviously illogical. d6 Ideal 1 Greatest of Them All.

Among your own people, you hold a position of honor and respect. To the other free peoples, you are a symbol of future alliances and distant hope. Yet, to Izrador and his armies, you are a threat to be eradicated. Your role requires that you carry some mark of authority and license, bestowed upon you by your lord or people. This often takes the form of an object like a signet ring, a written letter, or a rod of office, but it can also be something more subtle like an easily hidden tattoo or brand. Should this mark ever be discovered by the Shadow’s forces, your life would be in great danger. Should it be taken from you, the evil use they could put it to would be unthinkable.

Should your mission be known to them, the free peoples of Eredane will welcome you into their safe havens and, should your mission require it, even to the audience of their lords and ladies.

Most criminals get away, so when they do catch them, those in charge like to make an example with a public spectacle. People weren’t exactly lining up for the job and most decent people understandably see this as undesirable work. You took to the work. Perhaps a forebear of yours, and one of their forebears before them had the job; and it has become a family profession. Perhaps it was an outlet for your darker desires that would have led you to the block. Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Medicine Tool Proficiencies: Your choice of dice or playing cards Languages: Thieves’ cant Equipment: A black hood, the tool you used for execution, a set of dice or playing cards that you took from a prisoner, an outfit stained with blood, a set of traveler’s clothes, a belt pouch containing 10 gp. Dark Reputation Because the job is so unseemly, you’ve spent your life living in the fringes of polite society; perhaps being forced to live outside the city. This social isolation led you to interacting with other outcasts to find friends. This has in turn meant your social circle includes lepers, prostitutes, and criminals that haven’t been caught or whose crimes aren’t severe enough to put them before you on a workday. This makes you even more of a pariah. Some executioners embrace their reputation, and revel in the fear that people have of them. They can sometimes use their position as a way to harm people and be able to avoid repercussions. D4 Dark Reputation 1 I executed an heir to the throne on the behest of their usurper, but the usurper was deposed and they called my actions a crime. 2 A moment of bloodlust led to me executing someone in a manner seen as too much and had me replaced by someone with more restraint. 3 As an apprentice, I was forced to practice on stray dogs to desensitize me. I kept it up after it was no longer expected. 4 The laws changed and my profession was seen as obsolete. Kindness was the new normal. Was it kindness to force me to retire? Being an executioner isn’t inherently evil, not all killing is murder after all (or at least, that’s what the people who hired you tell you). Some people come into the job like any other job, jobs need to be done and people need to work in order to make money to live. Sometimes though, the circumstances that arise from killing in the name of the state leads those with scruples away. Option: Righteous Resignation D4 Righteous Resignation 1 The people rose up against a tyrant and I was the one to kill them, but the loyalists retook power and now I am wanted. 2 A moment of hesitation during an execution led me being seen as inefficient and a liability in maintaining law and order. 3 As an apprentice, I was forced to practice on stray dogs to desensitize me. Killing people wasn’t difficult, but killing animals still pains me. 4 The laws of the land changed, favoring rehabilitation. I am relieved to be free from this burden. Feature: Inner Workings Within a settlement of sufficient size, you know whom to talk to and whom to ask to find out information about crime and punishment. Unless that information is intentionally being kept secret, you can always find out who is imprisoned, who is scheduled to die soon and also information about anyone who is currently wanted. People familiar with your background will volunteer this information just to get you to leave their presence sooner. Suggested Characteristics Executioners are often grim, whether in sense of humor, expression, or personality. Their sense of justice can also become skewed as part of their line of work, though whether it is stronger or weaker depends on the individual. D8 Personality Traits 1 I try to talk as little as possible, and when I do, I do not mince words. 2 I rarely smile, or show any outward emotion. 3 I prefer to let others make decisions for me, that way I have no blame when things go wrong. 4 Watching a person die hardly stirs me, but if someone harms an animal unnecessarily, watch out. 5 My speech is laden with foul language and impolite epithets. 6 Whenever I meet someone, I imagine what it would be like to execute them. 7 I find death to be humorous. When faced with death, I make terrible puns and bad jokes. 8 The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, I will judge harshly and think poorly of people based on their parentage. D6 Ideals 1 Power. Life and death are most important when they are at my fingertips and within my control. (Evil) 2 Order. Laws are meant to be obeyed, it doesn’t matter if we think they are fair. (Lawful) 3 Apathy. If you don’t want to suffer the consequences, you shouldn’t commit crimes. (Neutral) 4 Retribution. The courts move too slowly, I know who is guilty and I should be able to punish people on my own. (Chaotic) 5 Redemption. Everyone should have a chance to make things right, my trade should be unnecessary. (Good) 6 Bloodlust. Nobody is innocent, nobody deserves forgiveness. (Evil) D6 Bonds 1 The one who taught me the trade was my first victim, I’ve never forgiven the one who ordered me to do so. 2 I have a child or sibling that I left behind, I hope to reunite with them someday. 3 I hope to someday, somehow, atone for the blood that is on my hands. 4 I once killed someone who was wearing a mask, legally, they had no name. I want to find out who they were. 5 I never want to see anyone forced to walk the same path as I have. The choice should not be taken lightly. 6 Someone was once pardoned right at the last minute, no doubt due to bribery. I vow to bring them to true justice. D6 Flaws 1 I drown myself in drink to dull the guilt of all the lives I’ve ended. 2 I genuinely enjoy killing, I enjoy it so much that it is hard to stop. 3 I’ve taken a bribe to fake an execution, certain members of the criminal underground know. 4 I’ve sold body parts to necromancers and other practitioners of the dark arts. 5 I obey legitimate authority, regardless of notions of “right or wrong”. 6 I don’t care if my macabre sense of humor makes others uncomfortable.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Lone Colossus Games","book":"Injuries and Vile Deeds"},{"name":"Exile","description":"Sometimes seen as a fate worse than death, exile has long been a popular sanction for radicals, dissidents, and troublemakers. Exiling these people allows the authorities to remove a thorn from their sides without creating a martyr or having to keep the unwanted person in costly perpetual captivity. Many a coup or revolution has resulted in the leaders and courtiers of the old regime being consigned to exile, sometimes on a moon or neighboring planet, sometimes on the other side of the ‘verse. On occasion, a person may choose exile voluntarily, either as an alternative to something worse or because they desire time on the Frontier to grow and develop. An exile has a unique opportunity to absorb foreign cultures and contact émigré communities while rallying support remotely. Living in exile might provide benefits that aren't available back home, such as the freedom to pursue otherwise forbidden love interests or take advantage of more lenient tax policies, either of which could deliver the impetus to accept a self-imposed exile. Exiles take to adventuring for a number of reasons. For some, their exile was only temporary, and now they seek to embark on a dangerous journey home, while others might seek to foment rebellion in absentia so as to be welcomed as liberating heroes on their return. Some exiles are gripped by wanderlust, traveling the world with a small group of companions. The unluckiest of all, however, might find themselves unwelcome everywhere, with no choice other than to continue wandering forever. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Survival Languages: Any two of your choice Equipment: A dagger, a small strongbox, a memento from your homeland, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 5 gp Feature: Exile Network You keep in touch with a network of exiles and expatriates, who possess an eclectic mix of skills and the durable spirit of pioneers. If you need to find someone with an unusual or specialized skill (such as art forgery, translation of ancient languages, or poison-brewing), you likely know where to find them. Variant Feature: Radical Sympathizers As a prominent figurehead for a group of religious, political, or ethnic radicals, you are often able to find people who sympathize with your situation. When you employ hirelings, they may offer you better rates, fanatical loyalty, or enhanced services. Reason for Exile You were exiled for a reason. Choose a ‘crime’ or roll on the table below to determine why you were forced to leave your home. d10 Crime 1 Opposition to political rulers 2 Tax exile 3 Religious dissent/radicalism 4 Sentenced to exile for serious crime 5 Death sentence commuted to exile after committing capital crime 6 Forbidden love 7 Refugee displaced by war or disaster 8 Escaping shameful failures committed at home 9 Fleeing false accusations 10 Self-imposed exile/journey of self-discovery Suggested Characteristics Being exiled is a deeply painful experience, and life as a stateless persona non grata is extremely challenging. Such a trial is sure to leave some marks on the exile’s personality. d8 Personality Trait 1 I jump whenever anyone knocks on my door. 2 I stand by my principles, rather than compromising them. 3 Hand-written letters are my preferred means of communication. 4 I am fascinated by different cultures. 5 I sometimes become pensive and withdrawn. 6 I have a lot of interesting and unusual friends. 7 I often reminisce about my years before exile. 8 I write a lot of poetry in my spare time. d6 Ideal 1 Homecoming.

The size of the city changes to match the overall health of the Rothenian lands. In times of strife, turmoil, and war, the city grows, adding wagons and walls to accommodate the increase. During times of peace, the city's population shrinks. It is said that once Misto Cherno consisted of just four walled wagons. As long as there are those with few scruples, the Black City rolls. You are from this villainous place. Your story before finding a home among the Khazzak and Kariv bandits is yours to decide. What events led you to take a place by the fires of Misto Cherno? What choice did you have? Were you born inside the wooden walls? Perhaps you were a captive, taken in a raid by foul-tempered centaurs who thought to sell you to slavers—or worse. Now, and perhaps just this very hour, you have been exiled from Misto Cherno. Whether your exile was self-imposed or decreed by the lord herself, you are no longer welcome in the city of bandits. Perhaps you felt called to some other purpose. Perhaps you found a god in the smoke and the callous laughter of thieves. What has changed your heart, such that banditry no longer suits it? This road will be long. Many will not trust you. The dark and twisting tendrils from your time in Misto Cherno will always seek you. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Thieves' tools, vehicles (land) Equipment: a set of traveler's clothes, a mule, two sacks containing a set of thieves' tools and 10 gp Feature: Know Evil Your time in the Black City left a mark on your spirit and your flesh. Dark deeds lie in your past, and you have a keen insight into the motivations of evil-aligned beings. Unless a creature's alignment is obscured by magical means, you know whether a creature's alignment is evil after interacting with it or for a minute or more. Also, you must choose the location on your body where the five-spoked wheel was branded into your flesh. Showing the mark to bandits, criminals, burglars, thieves, and other unsavory types (GM's discretion) grants you advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with them, but good folk are likely to turn against you if your past is revealed.

I value my right to privacy and keep out of other people's business (any). 5 Nihilism. I have seen the dark heart of mortals and have little regard for their plans and intentions (Chaotic). 6 Purpose. I have found a greater purpose in my life and pursue it at any cost (any). d6 Bond 1 I will have revenge upon those who organized my exile. Misto Cherno will burn. 2 I reject villainy—so long as I am present, none will be bullied or oppressed. 3 Power and riches will be mine; I will rise in station and tower over those who betrayed me. 4 My exile is a blessing and a gift. I will cleanse others of their evil so that they too might be delivered. 5 I must flee the Rothenian Plain, and abandon my former self, becoming an entirely different person. 6 One day, I will return to Misto Cherno and take over its rulership. d6 Flaw 1 I overcompensate for my evil past. 2 I almost never trust others, even those who are close and deserving. 3 I am prone to bouts of extreme violence when stressed—these displays may shock others. 4 I am often tempted by the quick rewards of criminal behavior. 5 Money is often enough to earn my allegiance. 6 I have trouble working in a team, and struggle to form relationships.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Expanse Immigrant","description":"Expanse Immigrant “No one’s ever going to drive me from my home again.” You’ve arrived in the Expanse hoping for a better life.

In Kanrath, the most common blood practice is leech therapy, where the scientists or the state officials drain “the dirty’’ blood and replace it with a more “clean” and “pure” one. It has little to no scientific accuracy but it is believed that it reveals powers that lie in one’s blood or that it provides the experimented with new powers related to blood. Most leech therapy victims die due to blood loss or the fact that their bodies cannot withstand the change in their blood. Cyherested is famous for its blood treatments, where multiple alchemical compounds are transferred into the experimented’s blood to reveal one’s sorcery abilities. The duration of the process varies. It can take hours or it can take months. What both practices have in common is the pain inflicted on the experimented, and the trauma experienced by the victims.

These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction’s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don’t merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerûn. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn’t necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction. Skill Proficiencies: Insight and one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill of your choice, as appropriate to your faction Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp Factions of the Sword Coast The lack of large, centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in those lands. If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some possibilities. The Harpers. Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers’ ideals. The Order of the Gauntlet. One of the newest power groups in Faerûn, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s ideals, and the clergy of the order’s patron gods. The Emerald Enclave. Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature. The Lords’ Alliance. On one level, the agents of the Lords’ Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance’s ideals. The Zhentarim. In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren’t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the Zhentarim. Feature: Safe Haven As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words “faith” and “faction” to be interchangeable.) Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide"},{"name":"Failed Merchant","description":"Maybe you come from a long line of merchants.

I’ll do everything in my power to protect them. 6 I owe a dangerous person a lot of money. As long as they’re happy, they let my debt rest unpaid. d6 Flaw 1 Why spend gold here when you can buy the same thing for copper in the next town? 2 I must have the best of everything. Like, right now. 3 You haven’t heard of me? I’m sure that’s because of your ignorance and low breeding. 4 I failed, but I’m awesome. So when anyone else is successful, it must be because of nepotism, dishonesty, or dumb luck. 5 I find that most people are trustworthy.

Secretly, you’re only apologizing because doing so allows you to continue your villainy behind a rehabilitated façade. What crimes have you committed? Work with your GM to determine how your atrocities fit into the story and what your actions mean for the people you harmed. As someone who is pretending to make honest amends, you could be adventuring to bring your victims something they need, or they could have sent you on a quest that you want to exploit for your own gain. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth Tool Proficiencies: Forgery kit Languages: One of your choice Equipment: Forgery kit, a letter of agreement between you and the people you wronged, and a pouch containing 20 gp Reason for False Apology Every villain has their reasons. Choose or randomly determine why you are saying sorry by rolling on the Reason for False Apology table. D6 Reason For False Apology 1 I need to ingratiate myself with someone powerful, but they want me to apologize before they’ll consider talking to me. 2 It’s part of my punishment for the crimes I committed. 3 My victims have resources I want, and I need to build trust to access them. 4 I tried to get away with my villainous acts, but I was caught. Apologizing is the only socially acceptable option. 5 I am planning a comeback and the more convincing I can make this lie, the more dramatic and impactful my return will be. 6 It’s the only way to avoid being killed for my actions. Feature: Scum and Villainy Though your days of open villainy are over, you can still conduct business with discretion. You can keep your activities away from prying eyes by using the networks you built at the height of your villainy. Work with the GM to create two or three NPC contacts who you know and establish their jobs and locations. These NPCs are on good terms with you and view you as a reliable business partner. Whenever you work with one of these contacts, they can see to it that your unsavory activities remain hidden. Suggested Characteristics False apologizers are conscious of their reputations and are aware of what others might think of them. Some are guarded and insecure about their misdeeds, whereas others are more open and comfortable discussing their past. D8 Personality Trait 1 I proudly introduce myself as a former villain everywhere I go, and I enjoy the shocked reaction I receive every time. 2 I dress in unremarkable, plain clothing to show humility and sincerity, and I keep my weapons hidden. 3 I always tip shopkeepers and service workers. 4 I am unerringly polite, even when I am insulted. 5 I rarely apologize for mundane mistakes because I don’t want to cheapen the meaning of the apology for my villainy. 6 I can hold my own in battle against enemies three times my size. I’m confident in my combat prowess. I believe I can win any fight, no matter the odds. 7 I don’t help others for praise or thanks, but I never turn down a compliment. 8 I’m used to having others do things for me and I fumble with basic tasks. D6 Ideal 1 Choices. Actions matter more than words. (Any) 2 Honesty. Everyone must know the truth about what I did and what I am doing to atone for it. (Good) 3 Indifference. Third-party opinions are unimportant and irrelevant. (Neutral) 4 Justice. Those who were wronged should decide the perpetrator’s fate. (Lawful) 5 Power. Only the foolish accept apologies. (Evil) 6 Self-image. I’ll put myself in harm’s way if it makes me look more sympathetic. (Chaotic) D6 Bond 1 No matter how notorious I become, the people closest to me know who I really am, and that is all that matters. 2 The people I hurt deserve everything I can give them, and more. I care only for myself and my good deeds are incidental.. 3 My victims gave me a second chance, and I will never forget their kindness. 4 My life belongs to the community I serve. 5 I must impress someone of a higher social standing than me. 6 The people in my hometown face unfair prejudices because of me and I’ll correct that. D6 Flaw 1 I miss my days of true villainy, when I had the power to do what I wanted with impunity. 2 I could walk away from my apology any time I want, and I am sometimes tempted to do so. 3 I talk about my villainous past a bit too casually. 4 I’m still not used to being held accountable and my immediate impulse is to defend myself from any accusation. 5 Being told that my efforts aren’t good enough puts me in a foul mood. 6 I constantly have to curb my desire to be the center of attention.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Lone Colossus Games","book":"Injuries and Vile Deeds"},{"name":"Families of the Fleet - Mantis Clan","description":"For complicated historical reasons, members of the Mantis Clan do not have a family name. Its samurai all belong to the Mantis fleet, however, and so they take their names from the ships they sail with. Kudaka of the Bitter Wind or Hitoshi of the Osano-wo are how they style themselves, changing their names as they sign on with different crews.

You aren’t one of those folk. You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerûn for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share. Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land’s ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you’ve never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you’re a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception Tool Proficiencies: Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland Languages: Any one of your choice Equipment: One set of traveler’s clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faerûn, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland’s craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5 gp Why Are You Here? A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each location. Why Are You Here? d6 Reason 1 Emissary 2 Exile 3 Fugitive 4 Pilgrim 5 Sightseer 6 Wanderer Where Are You From? The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background. Evermeet. The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland. Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society. Halruaa. Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic. Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic. Kara-Tur. The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin. The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over. Mulhorand. From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerûn. Those who leave behind Mulhorand’s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home. Sossal. Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white. Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important. Zakhara. As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, “To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.” Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn’t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have. You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities. The Underdark. Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place—but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child. If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren’t a native, your reason for leaving “home” probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation. Feature: All Eyes on You Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland. You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people. Suggested Characteristics d6 Personality Trait 1 I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others’ space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own. 2 I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting. 3 I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don’t comprehend. 4 I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others. 5 I honor my deities through practices that are foreign to this land. 6 I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me. d6 Ideal 1 Open.

The details of this early life can be various, depending on how far-reaching the belief in your specialness was and the tone of it. You may have been deemed unlucky or existentially dangerous—feared and ostracized, grown up under the dark shadow of superstition (and maybe real magic). Conversely, a positive, or more open-ended Omen may have burdened you with the hopes and dreams of your community—maybe you were spoiled, always allowed to do as you pleased despite common sense and decency—or maybe you are an asset for the power-hungry to fight over and control. You have embraced the cards fate has dealt you. Chosen one, people called you, and you listened. You seek to fulfill the prophecy or embody the omen that has defined your entire life. You refuse to believe it isn’t real, or maybe you’ve decided to fake it until you make it. Regardless, this has garnered you support from and duty toward the people whose belief shaped you. Skill proficiencies: pick two from Arcana, Deception, Intimidation, Perception, and Religion. Tool proficiencies: Pick one based on your upbringing or omen.

Choose or randomly determine your omen or prophecy. D8 Omens And Prophecies 1 You were born as everything went dark under a total eclipse of the sun, and you only started crying once the light returned. 2 Your mother took a fall that hastened your birth an entire month. Your twin was stillborn, but you were the picture of health and, as such, considered blessed. 3 The river near your village ran inexplicably red the day you were born, and it killed most of the fish. The subsequent year was a hungry one. Folk say you’re bad luck. 4 You are the child of a charismatic religious leader and his beautiful wife, whose womb, rumor had it until then, was barren. They said you were a gift from their god, a chosen savior who could do no wrong. The faithful believe it. 5 You were born with the umbilical cord wrapped around your neck like a hangman’s noose. Your father wanted to kill you then and there, but your mother and aunt didn’t let him. 6 You come from an old and proud lineage whose seventh children have a habit of dying early. All of them, until you came along. The family wizard assures them this marks you as someone chosen to change the world. 7 You were born with an axe-shaped birthmark on the palm of your left hand, just like a famous conqueror from the past supposedly did. Then you grew up left-handed. The first assassin came for you when you were four years old. 8 That crazy uncle always said his nephew would be “the emissary from the darkness between the stars!”. When you opened your eyes—one silver-colored, the other pitchblack— people started worrying about what it meant. Variant Feature: Chosen Champion You grew up in a community with high hopes pinned on your fabulous fate. You can find scattered members of this community in any big city.

Regardless of whether it was by choice or by chance, the effect on you is the same. You live, hunt, eat, and sleep in solitude. Caves are your shelter, the ground your bed, and the creatures of the Forest your companions. You have learned that you can trust no one but yourself and that you will live, and ultimately die, by your Skills, wits, and Strength. The Forest Provides Having spent most of your life within the Forest providing for yourself, you have learned how to Forage, hunt, and fish well enough to ensure your Survival in a Forest. If you spend 2 hours investigating game trails, spoor, and foliage in a Forest, you are able to procure enough food to feed yourself and up to four others for one day. In addition, you are able to determine if any water you find in the Forest is potable. D8 Personality Trait 1 I will never forget being hungry in the winter. I field dress beasts that fall to blade or arrow so that I am never hungry again. 2 I may be alone in the forest, but I am only ever lonely in cities. 3 Walking barefoot allows me to interact more intuitively with the natural world. 4 The road is just another kind of wall. I make my own paths and go where I will. 5 Others seek the gods in temples and shrines, but I know their will is only revealed in the natural world, not an edifice constructed by so-called worshippers. I pray in the woods, never indoors. 6 What you call personal hygiene, I call an artificially-imposed distraction from natural living. 7 No forged weapon can replace the sheer joy of a kill accomplished only with hands and teeth. 8 Time lived alone has made me accustomed to talking loudly to myself, something I still do even when others are present.

The forest and the Old Ways are eternal. 6 I am driven to protect the natural order from those that would disrupt it. D6 Flaw 1 I am accustomed to doing what I like when I like. I’m bad at compromising, and I must exert real effort to make even basic conversation with other people. 2 I won’t harm a beast without just cause or provocation. 3 Years of isolated living has left me blind to the nuances of social interaction. It is a struggle not to view every new encounter through the lens of fight or flight. 4 The decay after death is merely the loam from which new growth springs—and I enjoy nurturing new growth. 5 An accident that I caused incurred great damage upon my forest, and, as penance, I have placed myself in self-imposed exile. 6 I distrust the undead and the unliving, and I refuse to work with them.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":16},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Margreve Player's Guide"},{"name":"Fey Hostage","description":"Years, possibly centuries, ago you were captured by the fey. Each host, as the fey called themselves, treated their “guest” differently. The relationship you forged with your captors defines you just as strongly as the circumstances of your abduction and of your escape or release. You have been indelibly marked—emotionally, psychically, and physically—by the fey and their special brand of hospitality.

Choose or randomly determine the reason behind your sojourn in the realm of the fey. d8 Event 1 My childhood was tithed to the fey by my family in return for prosperity for as long I remained in their care. 2 I made a bargain with a fox to play with its cubs in their den. The fox turned out to be an emissary of the Summer Court, and I was not released until the cubs came of age. 3 Centuries ago my ancestors were rulers and made a political alliance with the fey in exchange for tribute to be paid every third generation. We are no longer rulers, but the fey still demand their tithe. 4 I have no memories of my past before I was taken by the fey. 5 I wandered into an ancient, primeval wood shortly after learning to walk and was found by the fey, who took me in. 6 A fey child befriended me and invited me to their home. 7 I am the only survivor of a fey raid.

Each host, as the fey called themselves, treated their “guest” differently. The relationship you forged with your captors defines you just as strongly as the circumstances of your abduction and of your escape or release. You have been indelibly marked—emotionally, psychically, and physically—by the fey and their special brand of hospitality.

Choose or randomly determine the reason behind your sojourn in the realm of the fey. d8 Event 1 My childhood was tithed to the fey by my family in return for prosperity for as long I remained in their care. 2 I made a bargain with a fox to play with its cubs in their den. The fox turned out to be an emissary of the Summer Court, and I was not released until the cubs came of age. 3 Centuries ago, my ancestors were rulers and made a political alliance with the fey in exchange for tribute to be paid every third generation. We are no longer rulers, but the fey still demand their tithe. 4 I have no memories of my past before I was taken by the fey. 5 I wandered into an ancient, primeval wood shortly after learning to walk and was found by the fey, who took me in. 6 A fey child befriended me and invited me to their home. 7 I am the only survivor of a fey raid. They killed my parents but spared me for their own unknowable reasons. 8 My parents could not care for me, and their choices were to abandon me in a forest or a city. They chose the forest.

Perhaps you were spirited away by kindly Fey who thought you were destined for great things. Perhaps you stumbled through a fey crossing by chance during a twilight stroll in the woods. Perhaps you were kidnapped by evil Fey but escaped from their clutches. Whatever the manner of your disappearance, you gradually fell under the Feywild’s spell and learned a little about the nature of the mercurial tricksters that dwell there. When you finally returned to your home plane, you did not come back unchanged. You are haunted by the fact that the Feywild—a mirror world hidden behind a mere twist of perception—is only a hair’s breadth away. Although your memories of the Feywild grow fainter with each passing day, your heart swells with a mixture of fear and joy at the prospect of one day venturing back to the Plane of Faerie—your home away from home. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Survival Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument Languages: One of your choice of Elvish, Gnomish, Goblin, or Sylvan Equipment: A musical instrument (one of your choice), a set of traveler’s clothes, three trinkets (each determined by rolling on the Feywild Trinkets table), and a pouch containing 8 gp Fey Mark You were transformed in some small way by your stay in the Feywild and gained a fey mark, determined by rolling on the Fey Mark table.

Feywild Visitor Whenever you’re sound asleep or in a deep trance during a long rest, a spirit of the Feywild might pay you a visit, if the DM wishes it. Determine the spirit’s form by rolling on the Feywild Visitor table. No harm ever comes to you as a result of such visits, which can last for minutes or hours, and you remember each visit when you wake up. Conversations that occur with a visitor can contain any number of things, from messages and insights to nonsense and red herrings, at the DM’s discretion. Such conversations are always conducted in a language you can understand, even if the Feywild visitor can’t speak that language normally.

Because of this, friendly Fey creatures are inclined to come to your aid if you are lost or need help in the Feywild. Character Traits As the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters’ personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the Player’s Handbook , or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn’t make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table. These tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background. Personality Traits d8 Trait 1 I’m haunted by fey laughter that only I can hear, though I know it’s just my mind playing tricks on me. 2 Like a nomad, I can’t settle down in one place for very long. 3 Good music makes me weep like a baby. 4 Wherever I go, I try to bring a little of the warmth and tranquility of home with me. 5 I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder. 6 When I have a new idea, I get wildly excited about it until I come up with another, better idea. 7 I live by my own set of weird and wonderful rules. 8 I can’t bring myself to trust most adults.

Halfway between public and private, the finagler is the go-to official for Knaves confronting the law, the nobility, and justice because – while being Knaves themselves – they are perfectly integrated into the system and know how to interact with, persuade, and corrupt everyone else: guards, Royal Bounty agents, and big shots. Skill Proficiencies : Investigation, Persuasion Tool Proficiencies : Forgery Kit Languages : Macaronic Equipment : A copy of their home region’s book of laws, a bottle of black ink and a pen, a parchment, a set of fine clothes, and a pouch containing 20 sp.

You are the right Knave when it comes to \"fixing\" not-too-serious legal disputes. You can remove one of your Misdeeds or that of a member of your company. In order to do that, a cost equal to the Bounty value of the Misdeed you want to remove must be paid. This feature must be used before the Misdeed is added to a character's Bounty by the authorities. Suggested Characteristics Finaglers are colorful characters who often speak Macaronic or technical jargon, know all sorts of quibbles, codicils, and loopholes, and constantly come up with alternative and contradictory interpretations of laws and customs. They love precision and order, read and write perfectly, and are fond of pointing this out. They tend to act aloof and see themselves as superior to the more common Knaves, and in companies they typically cover the roles of accountants, notaries, scribes, and yeomen. d8 Personality Trait 1 I am a master of the fine art of the jibber-jabber and I try not to miss a single occasion to run it on the first guy that comes along. 2 I take on every favor request I receive. Of course, I also accept payment in kind. 3 I am mainly interested in the analysis of the law. I've collected many written documents that I like to carefully study in my spare time. 4 I often utter phrases and mottos in Macaraonic, to show off my erudtion. 5 I love to deal with influential people, especially when I manage to silence personalities such as nobles and ordinals. 6 They call me the patron saint of lost causes. I frequently get stuck trying to solve the most complex and tricky dilemmas. 7 With this silver tongue of mine, I could even sell ice to the varags. 8 I have a pompous stage name I used to be called when I was practicing the profession. d6 Ideal 1 Equal Opportunity. Even the poor and the unfortunate have the right to defend themselves from injustice. (Good) 2 Equality. Laws, conditions, and treatments must be the same for everyone.

I have no problem defending or assisting the worst tyrant or criminal, as long as I'm getting paid. (Evil) 5 Equanimity.

Perhaps you were born into a family of fisher folk, working with your kin to feed your village. Maybe the job was a means to an end—a way out of an undesirable circumstance that forced you to take up life aboard a ship. Regardless of how you began, you soon fell in love with the sea, the art of fishing, and the promise of the eternal horizon. Skill Proficiencies: History, Survival Languages: One of your choice Equipment: Fishing tackle, a net, a favorite fishing lure or oiled leather wading boots, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Harvest the Water You gain advantage on ability checks made using fishing tackle. If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day. Fishing Tale You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM’s discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions. You can roll on the following table to help determine the theme of your tale or choose one that best fits your character.

You found yourself in an underwater cave leading to the Abyss, and your luck has been sour ever since. 8 Love Story. You fell in love with a creature of pure water, but your brief romance ended tragically. Suggested Characteristics Fishers succeed only if they spend time at their jobs. As such, most fishers have a strong work ethic, and they admire others who earn their living honestly. Fishers tend to be superstitious, forming attachments to particular fishing lures or special fishing spots. They have a connection to the bodies of water in which they fish, and they think poorly of those whose actions adversely affect their livelihood. Fisher Personality Traits d8 Personality Traits 1 I am unmoved by the wrath of nature. 2 My friends are my crew; we sink or float together. 3 I need long stretches of quiet to clear my head. 4 Rich folk don’t know the satisfaction of hard work. 5 I laugh heartily, feel deeply, and fear nothing. 6 I work hard; nature offers no handouts. 7 I dislike bargaining; state your price and mean it. 8 Luck favors me, and I take risks others might not.

But something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event that caused you to leave your home for the wider world. D8 Event 1 You were living within the Western forest when the cesspools of magical refuse expanded and drove away the game that sustained you. You had to move to avoid the prospect of a long, slow demise via starvation. 2 Your village was razed by a contingent of Ghost Knights from King Lucan of the Grand Duchy of Morgau. For reasons of its own, the Margreve protected and hid you from their raid. 3 The Night Cauldron of Chernobog has bolstered the ranks of the mindless undead within the Northern Swamps. A roving band of skeletons and zombies attacked your family while you were hunting. 4 You are an ardent believer in the Old Ways. When the people of your village abandoned those beliefs, you were cast out and expelled into the Margreve. 5 You wandered into the Margreve as a child and became lost. For inexplicable reasons, the forest took an interest in you. You have faint memories of a village and have had no contact with civilization in many years. 6 You were your village’s premier hunter. They relied on you for game and without your contributions their survival in the winter was questionable. Upon returning from your last hunt, you found your village in ruins, as if decades had passed overnight. 7 Your quiet, peaceful, and solitary existence has been interrupted with dreams of the forest’s destruction, and the urge to leave your home compels you to seek answers. 8 Once in a hidden glen, you danced with golden fey and forgotten gods. Nothing in your life since approaches that transcendent moment, cursing you with a wanderlust to seek something that could. D8 Personality Trait 1 I will never forget being hungry in the winter. I field dress beasts that fall to blade or arrow so that I am never hungry again. 2 I may be alone in the forest, but I am only ever lonely in cities. 3 Walking barefoot allows me to interact more intuitively with the natural world. 4 The road is just another kind of wall. I make my own paths and go where I will. 5 Others seek the gods in temples and shrines, but I know their will is only revealed in the natural world, not an edifice constructed by so-called worshippers. I pray in the woods, never indoors. 6 What you call personal hygiene, I call an artificially-imposed distraction from natural living. 7 No forged weapon can replace the sheer joy of a kill accomplished only with hands and teeth. 8 Time lived alone has made me accustomed to talking loudly to myself, something I still do even when others are present. D6 Ideal 1 Change. As the seasons shift, so too does the world around us. To resist is futile and anathema to the natural order. (Chaotic) 2 Conservation. All life should be preserved and, if needed, protected. (Good) 3 Acceptance. I am a part of my forest, no different from any other flora and fauna. To think otherwise is arrogance and folly. When I die, it will be as a leaf falling in the woods. (Neutral) 4 Cull. The weak must be removed for the strong to thrive. (Evil) 5 Candor. I am open, plain, and simple in life, word, and actions. (Any) 6 Balance. The forest does not lie. The beasts do not create war. Equity in all things is the way of nature. (Neutral) D6 Bond 1 When I lose a trusted friend or companion, I plant a tree upon their grave. 2 The voice of the forest guides me, comforts me, and protects me. 3 The hermit who raised me and taught me the ways of the forest is the most important person in my life. 4 I have a wooden doll, a tiny wickerman, that I made as a child and carry with me at all times. 5 I know that the ways of civilizations rise and fall. The forest and the Old Ways are eternal. 6 I am driven to protect the natural order from those that would disrupt it. D6 Flaw 1 I am accustomed to doing what I like when I like. I’m bad at compromising, and I must exert real effort to make even basic conversation with other people. 2 I won’t harm a beast without just cause or provocation. 3 Years of isolated living has left me blind to the nuances of social interaction. It is a struggle not to view every new encounter through the lens of fight or flight. 4 The decay after death is merely the loam from which new growth springs—and I enjoy nurturing new growth. 5 An accident that I caused incurred great damage upon my forest, and, as penance, I have placed myself in self-imposed exile. 6 I distrust the undead and the unliving, and I refuse to work with them. Variant Forest Dweller: Feral One You abandoned civilization, or civilization abandoned you, for the forest long ago. Regardless of whether it was by choice or by chance, the effect on you is the same. You live, hunt, eat, and sleep in solitude. Caves are your shelter, the ground your bed, and the creatures of the forest your companions. You have learned that you can trust no one but yourself and that you will live, and ultimately die, by your skills, wits, and strength. Variant Feature: The Forest Provides Having spent most of your life within the forest providing for yourself, you have learned how to forage, hunt, and fish well enough to ensure your survival in a forest. If you spend 2 hours investigating game trails, spoor, and foliage in a forest, you are able to procure enough food to feed yourself and up to four others for one day. In addition, you are able to determine if any water you find in the forest is potable.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":16},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Margreve Player's Guide"},{"name":"Forest Dweller","description":"You are a creature of the forest, born and reared under a canopy of green.

If you spend 1 hour observing, examining, and exploring your surroundings while in a forest, you are able to identify a safe location to rest. The area is protected from all but the most extreme elements and from the nonmagical native beasts of the forest.

If one enters a forest unprepared, it is only a matter of time before such a person succumbs to either the whims of the spirits or the will of the wilds. Verdant and lush, forests resound with the melody of birdcalls, rustling leaves, and creaking wood as ancient trees settle into the soil. A wise person learns to live with the wild, perhaps even tame it a little, but they always absorb a bit of that wildness into themselves. In turn, the forests draw outcasts: bandits, hermits, and whole villages that wish to be left out of battles between warring nobles. These people develop their own idiosyncratic cultural practices, esoteric rituals, and even words, all influenced by the might of nature. Travelers often claim that trolls, tengu, and strange human-sized serpents still live in the forests. While “sophisticated” city folk scoff at these stories, those who live among the trees know better. Skill Proficiencies: Survival, choose one other Wisdom-based skill (Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, or Perception). Tool Proficiencies: Any one tool, mounts. Languages: You can read, sign, speak, and write Rokugani and one other common language of your choice. Equipment: Traveling clothes, any one tool, dagger or hatchet, and 7 sp. Suggested Feats: Clarity in Solace, Laborer’s Endurance, Survivalist’s Eye. Background Feature: Worldly Wisdom As a resident of a particular region, you have the following benefits: You have a general awareness of the political climate within your place of origin. You can name major families, prominent merchants, and other leaders in the region as well as their respective positions and allegiances. You know the layout and local residents in the neighborhood where you grew up or where you live now, along with any unusual features, shortcuts, or hidden wonders in your home region. You have knowledge of the impact of crime, poverty, or political unrest that you have experienced in your homeland. You know the trade that you grew up around extremely well, even if you do not practice it yourself. This might be woodcraft, hunting, or fishing in a rural village, commerce or artisanry in a bustling city, agriculture in a farming town, or sailing in a seaside port, to name only a few examples. You can always figure out where to go to get work when in your home region or a similar area.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":26129},"publisher":"Edge Studio","book":"Adventures in Rokugan"},{"name":"Former Adventurer","description":"As you belted on your weapons and hoisted the pack onto your back, you never thought you’d become an adventurer again. But the heroic call couldn’t be ignored. You’ve tried this once before—perhaps it showered you in wealth and glory or perhaps it ended with sorrow and regret. No one ever said adventuring came with a guarantee of success. Now, the time has come to set off toward danger once again. The reasons for picking up adventuring again vary. Could it be a calamitous threat to the town? The region? The world? Was the settled life not what you expected? Or did your past finally catch up to you? In the end, all that matters is diving back into danger. And it’s time to show these new folks how it’s done. Skill Proficiencies: Perception, Survival Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A dagger, quarterstaff, or shortsword (if proficient), an old souvenir from your previous adventuring days, a set of traveler’s clothes, 50 feet of hempen rope, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp Reason for Retirement Giving up your first adventuring career was a turning point in your life. Triumph or tragedy, the reason why you gave it up might still haunt you and may shape your actions as you reenter the adventuring life. Choose the event that led you to stop adventuring or roll a d12 and consult the table below. d12 Event 1 Your love perished on one of your adventures, and you quit in despair. 2 You were the only survivor after an ambush by a hideous beast. 3 Legal entanglements forced you to quit, and they may cause you trouble again. 4 A death in the family required you to return home. 5 Your old group disowned you for some reason. 6 A fabulous treasure allowed you to have a life of luxury, until the money ran out. 7 An injury forced you to give up adventuring. 8 You suffered a curse which doomed your former group, but the curse has finally faded away. 9 You rescued a young child or creature and promised to care for them. They have since grown up and left. 10 You couldn’t master your fear and fled from a dangerous encounter, never to return. 11 As a reward for helping an area, you were offered a position with the local authorities, and you accepted. 12 You killed or defeated your nemesis. Now they are back, and you must finish the job. Feature: Old Friends and Enemies Your previous career as an adventurer might have been brief or long. Either way, you certainly journeyed far and met people along the way. Some of these acquaintances might remember you fondly for aiding them in their time of need. On the other hand, others may be suspicious, or even hostile, because of your past actions. When you least expect it, or maybe just when you need it, you might encounter someone who knows you from your previous adventuring career. These people work in places high and low, their fortunes varying widely. The individual responds appropriately based on your mutual history, helping or hindering you at the GM’s discretion. Suggested Characteristics Former adventurers bring a level of practical experience that fledgling heroes can’t match. However, the decisions, outcomes, successes, and failures of your previous career often weigh heavily on your mind. The past seldom remains in the past. How you rise to these new (or old) challenges determines the outcome of your new career. d8 Personality Trait 1 I have a thousand stories about every aspect of the adventuring life. 2 My past is my own, and to the pit with anyone who pushes me about it. 3 I can endure any hardship without complaint. 4 I have a list of rules for surviving adventures, and I refer to them often. 5 It’s a dangerous job, and I take my pleasures when I can. 6 I can’t help mentioning all the famous friends I’ve met before. 7 Anyone who doesn’t recognize me is clearly not someone worth knowing. 8 I’ve seen it all. If you don’t listen to me, you’re going to get us all killed. d6 Ideal 1 Strength. Experience tells me there are no rules to war. Only victory matters. (Evil) 2 Growth. I strive to improve myself and prove my worth to my companions—and to myself. (Any) 3 Thrill. I am only happy when I am facing danger with my life on the line. (Any) 4 Generous. If I can help someone in danger, I will. (Good) 5 Ambition. I may have lost my renown, but nothing will stop me from reclaiming it. (Chaotic) 6 Responsibility. Any cost to myself is far less than the price of doing nothing. (Lawful) d6 Bond 1 I will end the monsters who killed my family and pulled me back into the adventuring life. 2 A disaster made me retire once. Now I will stop it from happening to anyone else. 3 My old weapon has been my trusted companion for years. It’s my lucky charm. 4 My family doesn’t understand why I became an adventurer again, which is why I send them souvenirs, letters, or sketches of exciting encounters in my travels. 5 I was a famous adventurer once. This time, I will be even more famous, or die trying. 6 Someone is impersonating me. I will hunt them down and restore my reputation. d6 Flaw 1 It’s all about me!

Maybe you lived in the north and saw the legions’ destruction of your society as they moved south and occupied your empty cities. Or perhaps you were an inhabitant of central or southern Erenland and were swept up by one of the many slaver patrols capturing anyone they could to toil for the Shadow. You may have even been born into captivity. Regardless of your origin, you are determined not to end your days laboring for the Shadow’s evil schemes. You may be plotting to escape your bonds and liberate your fellow captives, or perhaps you are content to pretend to remain “enslaved” while you plot to bring down the Shadow from within. Or maybe you became free long ago, and now you fight with the hatred of all who would enslave another burning within your breast. Few elves and dwarves are enslaved because the legates’ orders are to kill them on sight (or to interrogate and then kill them). Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Deception Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools Equipment: A ragged set of common clothes, 50 feet of hemp rope, a basic tool such as a light hammer or sickle, and a pair of shackles Feature: Knowledge of the Enemy Your time enslaved by the Shadow has taught you much about how the enemy lives and operates. You know the basics of how most legion military encampments, fortifications, and occupied towns are organized and guarded. You also know the means by which other enslaved people pass messages in their captivity, and you can send messages to them without being noticed. Suggested Characteristics While enslaved individuals may seem cowed and broken by the harshness of their captivity, some simply hide their inner strength beneath a veneer of servitude. An enslaved person may seem meek and harmless—right up until they are able to wrap their shackles around their oppressors’ throats. d8 Personality Trait 1 Although I can speak perfectly well, I pretend I cannot so that others do not notice me. 2 Although I am captured, I’ll never break. Turn your back on me at your peril! 3 My friendly demeanor always masks my true feelings about those around me. 4 I’m always ready with an encouraging word or helping hand for any who share my fate. We’re all in this together, and that’s how we’ll get out. 5 Patience is the best way to achieve freedom—and revenge. I can wait as long as I need to. 6 People die constantly in this life, and it’s best not to get too close to anyone. 7 Even in these dark days, I dream of a brighter future ahead. 8 Captivity has only made me hold tighter to the customs of my culture. d6 Ideal 1 Freedom: No one should be oppressed and enslaved—not by the Shadow and not by anyone else. (chaotic) 2 Revenge: I am going to ensure that those who enslaved me regret their actions for the rest of their short and painful lives. (any) 3 Inspiration: My freedom is something I have won. I want to inspire others to do the same. Let’s rise up and take back what is ours! (good) 4 A Simple Life: I just want to restore the simple and peaceful life I had before the Shadow took everything from me. (any) 5 Greater Understanding: I learned during my enslavement that under the Shadow, all beings are slaves to darkness. By defeating the Shadow, we can defeat the darkness within us. (lawful) 6 Individualism: I’m not defined by my ordeal. I say what I am and what I am not. (any) d6 Bond 1 A relative or friend of mine was also forced to labor for the Shadow, and they were taken away from me. I won’t rest until I find and free them. 2 I labored under a particularly cruel enslaver for many years. I want to kill them and to make sure they know I’m the one who did it. 3 I owe the resistance fighters who freed me my life. I will fight alongside them until the end. 4 I escaped captivity with a companion who did not survive the attempt. I still feel guilty that I lived and they did not. 5 Every enslaved person I free and lead to the mountains or the forest is one more soldier in the fight against the Shadow and one less laborer supporting Izrador. 6 I convinced a guard that what they were doing was wrong, and they helped me escape enslavement. Perhaps other minions of the Shadow can be convinced to see the error of their ways? d6 Flaw 1 I wake up every night with terrible nightmares of the horrible things I saw during my captivity. 2 I have repressed the memories of my experiences. If anyone asks about them, I angrily demand that they leave me be. 3 I reflexively say what I think people want to hear, rather than what I want to tell them. 4 When it comes to food and supplies, I always try and take more than my fair share and stockpile it for a rainy day. 5 When danger comes, my first instinct is always to hide. 6 My white-hot hatred for my old captors blinds me and keeps me from making sound decisions.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Edge Studio","book":"Midnight - Legacy of Darkness"},{"name":"Fortune Teller","description":"You have spent your life traveling with the circus as the resident fortune teller.

You should come up with a name for your former ship and its captain, as well as its hunting ground and the type of ships you preyed on. Did you sail under the flag of a bloodthirsty captain, raiding coastal communities and putting everyone to the sword? Or were you part of the Istagal Raiders, the former slaves turned pirates, who battle to end the vile slave trade in the White Sea? If you’re a minotaur, you likely sailed the Middle Sea, preying on ships between the ruined cities of the Moon Kingdom and the current strongholds of Capleon, Kaptaria and Kyprion. Or perhaps your hunting ground was the Western Ocean and the stretch of coastline running from the Dominion of the Wind Lords down to Lignas and Morreg? Maybe your vessel sailed the Corsair Coast, attacking merchant ships traveling the lucrative routes to and from Cathay in the east, or Zanskar far to the south, before hiding from the navies of Ishadia and Shibai among the Free Islands of Tethys? Whatever ship you sailed on, you feel at home on board a seafaring vessel, and long periods on dry land take some getting used to. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Navigator’s tools, vehicles (water) Equipment: a pirate flag from your ship, several tattoos, 50 feet of rope, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp. Feature: A Friendly Face in Every Port Your reputation precedes you. Whenever you visit a port city in the Southlands, you can always find someone who knows of (or has sailed on) your former ship and is familiar with its captain and crew. They are willing to provide you and your traveling companions with a roof over your head, a bed for the night, and a decent meal. If you have a reputation for cruelty and savagery, your host is probably afraid of you and will be keen for you to leave as soon as possible. Otherwise, you receive a warm welcome, and your host keeps your presence a secret if required. They may also provide you with useful information about recent goings-on in the city, including which ships have been in and out of port. Suggested Characteristics Freebooters are a boisterous lot, but their personalities include freedom-loving mavericks and mindless thugs. Nonetheless, sailing a ship requires discipline, so freebooters tend to be reliable and aware of their role on board, even if they do their own thing once fighting breaks out.

I owe them my life. 2 I still feel a deep attachment to my ship. Some nights I dream her figurehead is talking to me. 3 I was the ship’s captain until the crew mutinied and threw me overboard to feed the sharks. I swam to a small island and survived.

Whatever ship you sailed on, you feel at home on board a seafaring vessel, and you have difficulty adjusting to long periods on dry land. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Navigator’s tools, vehicles (water) Equipment: A pirate flag from your ship, several tattoos, 50 feet of rope, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: A Friendly Face in Every Port Your reputation precedes you. Whenever you visit a port city, you can always find someone who knows of (or has sailed on) your former ship and is familiar with its captain and crew. They are willing to provide you and your traveling companions with a roof over your head, a bed for the night, and a decent meal. If you have a reputation for cruelty and savagery, your host is probably afraid of you and will be keen for you to leave as soon as possible. Otherwise, you receive a warm welcome, and your host keeps your presence a secret, if needed. They may also provide you with useful information about recent goings-on in the city, including which ships have been in and out of port. Suggested Characteristics Freebooters are a boisterous lot, but their personalities include freedom-loving mavericks and mindless thugs. Nonetheless, sailing a ship requires discipline, and freebooters tend to be reliable and aware of their role on board, even if they do their own thing once fighting breaks out. Most still yearn for the sea, and some feel shame or regret for past deeds. d8 Personality Trait 1 I’m happiest when I’m on a gently rocking vessel, staring at the distant horizon. 2 Every time we hoisted the mainsail and raised the pirate flag, I felt butterflies in my stomach. 3 I have lovers in a dozen different ports. Most of them don’t know about the others. 4 Being a pirate has taught me more swear words and bawdy jokes than I ever knew existed. I like to try them out when I meet new people. 5 One day I hope to have enough gold to fill a tub so I can bathe in it. 6 There’s nothing I enjoy more than a good scrap—the bloodier, the better. 7 When a storm is blowing and the rain is lashing the deck, I’ll be out there getting drenched. It makes me feel so alive! 8 Nothing makes me more annoyed than a badly tied knot. d6 Ideal 1 Freedom. No one tells me what to do or where to go. Apart from the captain. (Chaotic) 2 Greed. I’m only in it for the booty. I’ll gladly stab anyone stupid enough to stand in my way. (Evil) 3 Comradery. My former shipmates are my family. I’ll do anything for them. (Neutral) 4 Greater Good. No man has the right to enslave another, or to profit from slavery. (Good) 5 Code. I may be on dry land now, but I still stick to the Freebooter’s Code. (Lawful) 6 Aspiration. One day I’ll return to the sea as the captain of my own ship. (Any) d6 Bond 1 Anti-slavery pirates rescued me from a slave ship. I owe them my life. 2 I still feel a deep attachment to my ship. Some nights I dream her figurehead is talking to me. 3 I was the ship’s captain until the crew mutinied and threw me overboard to feed the sharks. I swam to a small island and survived. Vengeance will be mine! 4 Years ago, when my city was attacked, I fled the city on a small fleet bound for a neighboring city. I arrived back in the ruined city a few weeks ago on the same ship and can remember nothing of the voyage. 5 I fell asleep when I was supposed to be on watch, allowing our ship to be taken by surprise. I still have nightmares about my shipmates who died in the fighting. 6 One of my shipmates was captured and sold into slavery. I need to rescue them. d6 Flaw 1 I’m terrified by the desert. Not enough water, far too much sand. 2 I drink too much and end up starting barroom brawls. 3 I killed one of my shipmates and took his share of the loot. 4 I take unnecessary risks and often put my friends in danger. 5 I sold captives taken at sea to traders. 6 Most of the time, I find it impossible to tell the truth.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Tome of Heroes"},{"name":"Freedom Fighter","description":"Your lands may have been occupied by the Shadow’s legions. Your life may have been taken from you by the Shadow. Your friends and family may still be living under the constant threat of oppression and death. But you chose not to go quietly into the night. You fight the Shadow in one of the many resistance groups across Eredane. Many groups of freedom fighters are scattered across the occupied lands. You may be one of the Dorns or Sarcosan freeriders who harass the Shadow’s convoys and patrols on the wide northern tundra or sweeping southern plains. You may fight under the flag of House Norfall, sailing with the free navies of the Sea of Pelluria. Or perhaps you worked to undermine the Shadow from within as part of the gnome smuggling and information networks or as a spy or saboteur in the occupied cities. Whatever your experience, you have already spent years working against the Shadow. Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Investigation Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit or forgery kit or poisoner’s kit Equipment: A disguise kit, a forgery kit, or a poisoner’s kit; nondescript clothing; a dark cloak and hood; and a belt with a hidden pouch Feature: Sympathetic Ally You have one ally in the occupied lands who is sympathetic to your cause. They try to provide you with food and information about the locale they live in whenever possible. You and that person have reliable (but slow) means of exchanging messages, and you can count on them for accurate intelligence. In a dire situation, they may also be able to hide you for a couple of days. Suggested Characteristics Freedom fighters must be fearless. They know that only a slow death awaits anyone who works against the Shadow, and yet they carry on the fight anyway. Many freedom fighters must also be pragmatic and cold, however. The legates are cunning foes who often try to infiltrate resistance networks using spies, informants, or even magical means. The freedom fighters who survive are the ones who are careful and cautious, never entirely trusting anyone. d8 Personality Trait 1 Trust is a good way to get yourself killed. I always sleep with one eye open, even when amongst “friends.” 2 I plan out every action twice over before I take it. 3 It may be a short life and a dangerous one, but I openly relish every day I can ride free against Izrador. 4 I’m impatient and tired of skulking about. When will we strike a true blow for freedom? 5 If I stopped to consider the odds, I would be dead a dozen times over. Bold actions shall carry me through the day. 6 I stay cool and collected, no matter what the situation is. 7 I can’t stop talking about the days before the Last Age, and what great things people will do when Izrador is defeated once again. 8 A lifetime of paranoia has left me grim, touchy, and generally unfriendly. d6 Ideal 1 Freedom: When the Shadow is broken, we can build a new world where everyone is free and no person is forced to bow before another. (Chaotic) 2 The Lost Kingdoms: I look to see the rightful rulers of these lands restored, and the lost kingdoms rebuilt. (Lawful) 3 The Resistance: The fight against Izrador is bigger than me or you. I may die, but if I do, I know that the resistance continues. (Any) 4 Faith: If one god can exist on Aryth, then others must exist as well. Just because they don’t help us doesn’t mean I don’t believe in them. (Lawful) 5 Liberty: I live for the day when the legates are hung from their obsidian towers, and the peoples of Eredane rejoice in their towns and villages. (Good) 6 Blood: Every servant of the Shadow who falls to my blade is a victory. Every collaborator deserves a traitor’s fate. (Evil) d6 Bond 1 One of the Shadow’s legions has built a camp in the ruins of my old village. I long for the day that I can see that camp burn and kill ten legionaries for each of my neighbors who was slain. 2 An army fights on its stomach. Raiding supply lines isn’t glamorous, but I believe every caravan we destroy does more damage than a dozen pitched battles. 3 I know the people of a nearby community yearn to rise up. I am slowly trying to inspire and lead them into open rebellion when the time is right. 4 One day I hope to join the dwarves or the elves and fight in their ranks against the Shadow. 5 A legate terrorizes my neighbors and has killed my friends. Their death will show Izrador’s lackies that they’re the ones who should fear us. 6 I was careless with my words, and some members of the resistance were killed because of it. I won’t ever let that happen again. d6 Flaw 1 If you’re not with us, you’re against us. Anyone who doesn’t fight against the Shadow is a collaborator. 2 I keep secrets from everyone, even my allies, as a matter of habit. 3 If I have doubts about someone’s loyalties, or if they are secretly a spy, it’s safer to kill them. 4 The villagers and townsfolk must keep us supplied and hidden. If they suffer reprisals from Izrador’s forces, I can’t be blamed. 5 I tend to trust what people tell me. Why would someone lie? 6 Most recruits to the resistance die quickly.

During downtime activities that involve games of chance or figuring odds on the best plan, you can get a solid sense of which choice is likely the best one and which opportunities seem too good to be true, at the DM’s determination. Suggested Characteristics Some gamble out of necessity. Others do so out of boredom. Still others become addicted to the thrill of winning or losing everything on a turn of fortune.

Regardless, you can always tell gamblers by the look in their eyes. Lady Luck haunts them. d8 Personality Trait 1 I plan for every contingency.

You know the requirements for encouraging a herd to grow, and you know what sustainable harvesting from a herd involves. You can train a hunting beast to recognize an owner and perform a half-dozen commands, given the time. You also know the etiquette for engaging nobility or other members of the upper classes, as they regularly seek your services, and you can carry yourself in a professional manner in such social circles. Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Persuasion Tool Proficiencies: Leatherworker’s tools Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of leatherworker’s tools, a hunting trap, fishing tackle, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Confirmed Guildmember As a recognized member of the Gamekeepers’ Guild, you are knowledgeable in the care, training, and habits of animals used for hunting. With 30 days’ of work and at least 2 gp for each day, you can train a raptor, such as a hawk, falcon, or owl, or a hunting dog, such as a hound, terrier, or cur, to become a hunting companion. Use the statistics of an owl for the raptor and the statistics of a jackal for the hunting dog. A hunting companion is trained to obey and respond to a series of one-word commands or signals, communicating basic concepts such as “attack,” “protect,” “retrieve,” “find,” “hide,” or similar. The companion can know up to six such commands and can be trained to obey a number of creatures, other than you, equal to your proficiency bonus. A hunting companion travels with you wherever you go, unless you enter a particularly dangerous environment (such as a poisonous swamp), or you command the companion to stay elsewhere. A hunting companion doesn’t join you in combat and stays on the edge of any conflict until it is safe to return to your side. When traveling overland with a hunting companion, you can use the companion to find sufficient food to sustain yourself and up to five other people each day. You can have only one hunting companion at a time. Suggested Characteristics You are one of the capable people who maintains hunting preserves, trains coursing hounds and circling raptors, and plans the safe outings that allow fair nobles, rich merchants, visiting dignitaries, and their entourages to venture into preserves and forests to seek their quarry. You are as comfortable hunting quarry in the forest as you are conversing with members of the elite who have an interest in hunting. d8 Personality Trait 1 Nature has lessons to teach us all, and I’m always happy to share them. 2 Once while out on a hunt, something happened which was very relatable to our current situation.

As a humble foot soldier, you almost certainly took part in the brief and bloody war to seize the Electoral Kingdom of Krakova for the Principalities, fighting alongside both undead troops and living warrior-priests of Mavros and Marena. Your bravery in battle and loyal service mean you are next in line to enter the ranks of the undead, joining the Order of the Red Shield as an Initiate Brother or Sister.

You can move at a fast travel pace outdoors without suffering a penalty to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score, and you can travel for up to 10 hours per day before risking exhaustion.

It’s hard not to become scarred by what they’ve experienced, but many ghost knights go on to develop strong ideals or form long-lasting bonds as a result of their time in the order. d8 Personality Traits 1 Before going into battle, I always make sure my sword is sharp and my armor has been polished until it gleams. 2 What I saw on the battlefields of Krakova still haunts me to this day. 3 However grim the situation, I try and find the humor in it to keep my comrades’ spirits up. 4 Ever since I joined the Ghost Knights, I prefer to sleep all day and be active during the night. 5 I swear a lot. It keeps me fucking sane. 6 Only an idiot blindly follows orders. 7 I like to tell stories of my military exploits and am not afraid to embellish my tales to make them more exciting. 8 If in doubt, stab first and ask questions later. d6 Ideal 1 Greater Good.

I will find and recover my children while punishing my spouse’s betrayal of my memory. 4 This rose engraved blade has seen my family’s fortunes fall. It will now see them rise again in eternal life. 5 The gnomes of Niemheim took me in when I was near my second death.

You can choose this variant only if you are not a darakhul or dhampir. As a “skilled” slave, you survived longer than your fellow “fleshling” slaves who were food for the Imperium’s masses. You might have served as the personal attendant to a noble who flaunted you as proof of their wealth or an artisan who had slaves supplement their apprentices—a darakhul who doesn’t need to eat its slave is a wealthy or talented darakhul indeed. You eventually made your escape by sneaking to the surface on a merchant’s caravan or through the many dark and dangerous tunnels of the Underworld. Perhaps a living merchant even took pity on you and smuggled you out. Whatever your role as a slave in the Ghoul Imperium and your method of escape, you are now free. Your former master might still be looking for you and your loved ones have long presumed you dead. Your Alter Ego is the new identity you have built for yourself after being unable to return to your former life, but your safehouse might be the home of a former traveling companion or relative who held out hope for your survival. Rather than proficiency in Performance, you might have proficiency with one set of artisan’s tools. And instead of a humanoid skull or femur, you can start with a small trinket you stole when you made your escape, though the trinket has no value except as something sentimental to your former ghoulish master.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Underworld Player's Guide"},{"name":"Giant Foundling","description":"Though you aren’t a Giant, you grew up among giants. Maybe you were an orphan taken in by a sympathetic family of stone giants who raised you as one of their own. Or perhaps you lived in a lost prehistoric pocket of the world, surrounded by giants and fearsome behemoths or hulking dinosaurs. Something about your environment—perhaps the food or water that sustained you, elemental magic inherent in the site of your home, or some verdant blessing of growth placed on you—caused you to grow to a remarkable size for your kind. With the aid of this magic, you have learned how to embody the might of giants. You are used to moving through a world much bigger than you, and that is reflected in your skills, attitude, and perspective on life. Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Survival Languages: Giant and one other language of your choice Equipment: A backpack, a set of traveler’s clothes, a small stone or sprig that reminds you of home, and a pouch containing 10 gp Origin Stories How you came to live among colossal creatures is up to you to determine, but the Foundling Origin table suggests a variety of possibilities. Foundling Origin d6 Origin 1 You were found as a baby by a family of nomadic giants who raised you as one of their own. 2 A family of stone giants rescued you when you fell into a mountain chasm, and you have lived with them underground ever since. 3 You were lost or abandoned as a child in a jungle that teemed with ravenous dinosaurs. There, you found an equally lost frost giant; together, you survived. 4 Your farm was crushed and your family killed in a battle between warring groups of giants. Racked with guilt over the destruction, a sympathetic giant soldier promised to care for you. 5 After you had a series of strange dreams as a child, your superstitious parents sent you to study with a powerful but aloof storm giant oracle. 6 While playing hide-and-seek with your friends, you stumbled into the castle of a cloud giant, who immediately adopted you. Feature: Strike of the Giants You gain the Strike of the Giants feat. Building a Giant Foundling Character Your life among giants has given you a unique perspective. Though you are unusually large for your kind, you’re no larger than a giant child, so you might be very mindful of your size. Suggested Characteristics. The Giant Foundling Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character. Giant Foundling Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 What I lack in stature compared to giants, I make up for with sheer spite. 2 I insist on being taken seriously as a full-grown adult. Nobody talks down to me! 3 Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable. I’d much rather be in an open field than a bustling tavern. 4 I embrace my shorter stature. It helps me stay unnoticed—and underestimated. 5 Every avalanche begins as a single pebble. 6 The world always feels too big, and I’m afraid I’ll never find my place in it.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Bigby Presents - Glory of the Giants"},{"name":"Gladiator","description":"A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer, trained to make the arts of co⁠mbat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy.

Just as you are part of the swarm, the swarm is part of a larger ecosystem, a never-ending cycle of life, death, rot, and rebirth. You have spent your life in the slow churn of that ecosystem, in the dark places of the city where the messy parts of existence are on display. There is little squeamishness among the Golgari , no fear of death or taboo about the dead, just a fierce affirmation of the cycle. Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Poisoner’s kit Languages: Choose one of Elvish, Giant, or Kraul Equipment: A Golgari insignia, a poisoner’s kit, a pet beetle or spider, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp worth of mixed coins Feature: Undercity Paths You know hidden, underground pathways that you can use to bypass crowds, obstacles, and observation as you move through the city. When you aren’t in combat, you and companions you lead can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow. The paths of the undercity are haunted by dangers that rarely brave the light of the surface world, so your journey isn’t guaranteed to be safe.

Suggested Characteristics Members of the Golgari Swarm are unmistakably products of the undercity, ill at ease amid the comforts of civilization. They bring about the same discomfort in others by reminding them of death’s inevitable approach. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 Remember, I could kill you in your sleep. Or put centipedes in your bedroll. 2 I like to remind people of their inevitable demise. 3 Sometimes I give voice to the whispers of the rot, which I hear but no one else does. 4 I do my best to discourage anyone from approaching or talking to me. 5 I have accepted my death. Hence, I don’t fear it. 6 Like roots growing through stone, I am relentless and determined in my action. 7 I put my knowledge of anatomy to use by narrating the injuries my enemies suffer in grisly detail. 8 Like a wild animal, I lash out viciously when I’m provoked—and I’m easily provoked.

A shovel and a well-groomed grave are all that you need to reach the riches you desire. However, every profession has its own difficulties, especially in Tolia. Bodies in Kanrath and Cyherested are used by city officials in many ways, for purposes such as blood experiments or raising an undead army. Dead bodies are thus quite valuable. It is likely for you to dig an empty grave, or clash with other graverobbers or enforcers while you’re trying to do your job. Regardless, if you can find a well-preserved body, or some belongings that it was buried with, you’re likely to make plenty of money.

Feature: Find Another Path Since you have lived your life close to the ground, you are familiar with the undergrowth in the same way other birdfolk are familiar with the canopy. You can always recall the general layout of the terrain around you while traveling along the forest floor. If your path is ever blocked by an obstacle that requires you to climb or otherwise gain height to circumvent it, you can always find a way around, so long as such a path exists. Additionally, you are adept at finding shelter in the Wood while traveling, and can usually locate a suitable safe shelter (a cave, a tree hollow, or bramble thicket) somewhere on the forest floor for you and up to five other creatures. Suggested Characteristics Birdfolk who are grounded often find ways to cope with their aversion to canopy life. Some have completely forsaken their old lives in favor of new ones in undergrowth communities, while others keep ties with family and friends in the perches where they were born. d8 Personality Trait 1 I always second guess my choices. 2 I have learned to not let the comments of others affect me. 3 I’m eager to show the benefits of my unique perspective. 4 I’m slow to trust someone new, but open up over shared hardships. 5 I manufacture difficult situations to prove my abilities. 6 I get embarrassed easily, even when someone tries to compliment me. 7 I will deny my fears to everyone. 8 I want to see how others handle situations I’m afraid of. d6 Ideal 1 Adversity. Others think of me as weak, but I will prove my worth with hard work and determination. (Lawful) 2 Encouragement. I try to seek out and support others like me who are seen as outcasts. (Good) 3 Exploration. I yearn to experience unique cultures and discover new places. (Chaotic) 4 Safety. In this dangerous world, it’s best to keep your head down and stay cautious. (Neutral) 5 Rebellion. Who cares what others think of me, so long as my actions reflect how I feel in my heart? (Chaotic) 6 Compromise. The best way to respect each other’s differences is to find a solution that doesn’t exclude anyone. (Good) d6 Bond 1 My family has been the subject of ridicule ever since I left my home perch. 2 A bully from my childhood now holds a position of power in my home perch. 3 I follow the teachings of a wise outcast I met in my travels. 4 I feel kinship to a culture outside my own. 5 I won’t tolerate anyone who insults me or my friends. 6 I have found a new family on the forest floor, and they mean more to me than anything. d6 Flaw 1 I am incapable of action when I’m at great heights. 2 I lash out at the slightest insult. 3 I keep a distance from others so they won’t learn of my fears. 4 I project my insecurities onto others. 5 I am uncouth and mannerless. 6 I find hard to trust other birdfolk.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Hit Point Press","book":"Humblewood"},{"name":"Gruul Anarch","description":"The entire world of Ravnica is a sprawling metropolis, but you are a native of the wild areas that still exist—the abandoned districts, the rubblebelts, the overgrown parks, and the crumbling ruins. You are part of a savage society that clings desperately to the Old Ways—attuned to nature, full of primal rage, and given short shrift by a world consumed with continuing civilization’s march of progress. Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Athletics Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism kit Languages: Choose one of Draconic, Giant, Goblin, or Sylvan Equipment: A Gruul insignia, a hunting trap, an herbalism kit, the skull of a boar, a beast-hide cloak, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins) Feature: Rubblebelt Refuge You are intimately familiar with areas of the city that most people shun: ruined neighborhoods where wurms rampaged, overgrown parks that no hand has tended in decades, and the vast, sprawling rubblebelts of broken terrain that civilized folk have long abandoned. You can find a suitable place for you and your allies to hide or rest in these areas. In addition, you can find food and fresh water in these areas for yourself and up to five other people each day. Gruul Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Gruul Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.

Suggested Characteristics Gruul ways aren’t the ways of civilized folk, and the Gruul have little patience for social niceties. But they do have cherished traditions and values, just as important to them as the different values held by the urban, cosmopolitan culture of Ravnica.

You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master in your own right. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of artisan’s tools (one of your choice), a letter of i⁠ntroduction from your guild, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp Guild Business Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly. d20 Guild Business 1 Alche&#8288mists and apothecaries 2 Armorers, locksmiths, and finesmiths 3 Brewers, distillers, and vintners 4 Calligraphers, scribes, and scriveners 5 Carpenters, roofers, and plasterers 6 Cartographers, surveyors, and chart-makers 7 Cobblers and shoemakers 8 Cooks and bakers 9 Glassblowers and glaziers 10 Jewelers and gemcutters 11 Leatherworkers, skinners, and tanners 12 Masons and stonecutters 13 Painters, limners, and sign-makers 14 Potters and tile-makers 15 Shipwrights and sailmakers 16 Smiths and metal-forgers 17 Tinkers, pewterers, and casters 18 Wagon-makers and wheelwrights 19 Weavers and dyers 20 Woodcarvers, coopers, and bowyers As a member of your guild, you know the skills needed to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan’s tools), as well as the principles of trade and good business practices. The question now is whether you abandon your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to weave adventuring and trade together. Feature: Guild Membership As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings. Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild’s coffers. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. Suggested Characteristics Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they’re vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness. d8 Personality Trait 1 I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can’t help it—I’m a perfectionist. 2 I’m a snob who looks down on those who can’t appreciate fine art. 3 I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick. 4 I’m full of witty aphorisms and have a proverb for every occasion. 5 I’m rude to people who lack my commitment to hard work and fai&#8288r play. 6 I like to talk at length about my profession. 7 I don’t part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible. 8 I’m well known for my work, and I want to make sure everyone appreciates it. I’m always taken aback when people haven’t heard of me. d6 Ideal 1 Community. It is the duty of all civilized people to strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization. (Lawful) 2 Generosity. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Good) 3 Freedom. Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic) 4 Greed. I’m only in it for the money. (Evil) 5 People. I’m committed to the people I care about, not to ideals. (Neutral) 6 Aspiration. I work hard to be the best there is at my craft. (Any) d6 Bond 1 The workshop where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me. 2 I created a great work for someone, and then found them unworthy to receive it. I’m still looking for someone worthy. 3 I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the person I am today. 4 I pursue wealth to secure someone’s love. 5 One day I will return to my guild and prove that I am the greatest artisan of them all. 6 I will get revenge on the evil forces that destroyed my place of business and ruined my livelihood. d6 Flaw 1 I’ll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless. 2 I’m quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me. 3 No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers. 4 I’m never satisfied with what I have—I always want more. 5 I would kill to acquire a noble title. 6 I’m horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my handiwork.

You don’t craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant’s life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan. Rather than proficiency with artisan’s tools, you might be proficient with navigator’s tools or an additional language. And instead of artisan’s tools, you can start with a mule and a cart.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Player's Handbook"},{"name":"Gye Valley - Non-Rokugani","description":"The Gye valley is the largest and most populous of the five major river-valleys of Saebyuksan and has substantial agriculture, producing enough to export to other valleys and even to other countries. Crops grown there are shipped through the Kkachi valley and traded as far away as Kinushima City. The Gye valley’s surplus goods have given its ruling family the chance to build expansive temples and shrines and continue the spiritual research into the art of invocations. At the largest sacred sites, one can observe invocations that are part storytelling performance, part rite, calling down the powers of ancient heroes and potent nature spirits. These rituals have continued to evolve in new ways since the departure of the Isawa, and so the two traditions have diverged in their respective quests for deeper understanding of the cosmos. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, choose one other Charisma-based skill (Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion). Tool Proficiencies: Any one artisan tool. Languages: You can read, sign, speak, and write Rokugani and Jindallaean. Equipment: Sanctified vestments or traveling clothes, dagger, any one artisan tool, and 5 gp. Suggested Feats: Charm Connoisseur, Clarity in Solace, Laborer’s Endurance. Background Feature: Neutral Party You have certain advantages due to being an outsider who is not implicated in local politics, such as: You have a general awareness of the political climate within your homeland.

You know the lay of the land where you grew up extremely well and know many people in that region. You know the trade that you grew up around well, even if you do not practice it yourself. Because you are from outside of Rokugan, members of Rokugani courts and other political organizations view you as being neutral to their conflicts.

At any time, it consists only of the ruler of the Empire, the Imperial spouse, and any children who potentially stand to inherit. Imperial heirs are taught by the best instructors available from the Great Clans, but their lofty position can make a traditional education difficult, for many instructors are loath to admonish a student of such standing. Members of the Hantei family are sometimes oddly sheltered—they sit at the head of one of the most powerful organizations in the world, yet they rarely leave the Imperial City. They wield unrivaled power, yet are separated from its consequences by so many layers of bureaucracy and distance. This can be difficult for many individuals to cope with, and if the plays and novels are to be believed, has led to more than a few members of the Hantei family sneaking out into the world incognito (or being thrust into it by happenstance).

Weapon Proficiencies: Wakizashi. Languages: You can read, sign, speak, and write Rokugani.

You can name Imperial family heads, ranking bureaucrats and other leaders, and you know their respective positions and allegiances. You know Imperial history quite well, particularly as it pertains to the deeds of the Emperor and the Imperial families. You know proper etiquette and protocol in the Imperial Capital. You know certain secrets that have been elided from the official histories of Rokugan.

Unfamiliar animals and plants, changed by hellish influence, assault the eyes with strange colors, textures, and movements. The wind blows bitter, and the nights are long. Scattered all throughout the world, one can find places palpably affected by the malign presence of vengeful ghosts, corrupted spirits, and unspeakable acts. The Crab Clan’s lands are often so afflicted, as if even the Kaiu Wall cannot fully contain the misery leaching out from the Shadowlands. The Yodha of the Ivory Kingdoms also know the vile denizens of the Shadowlands all too well, as they vigilantly guard the border between the Ghostlands and their gleaming cities. In other places, hungry spirits can become trapped in the realm of mortals, or they wander in from the unregulated slums of the Realm of the Hungry Dead, plaguing the living. Ancient battlefields with restless dead, forests filled with primordial hunters of humanity, and other fell places can have a similar effect. Yet life goes on, even in the face of such supernatural dread.

Feature: Born of the Soil You are familiar with the fields, forests, and mountains of the Blood Kingdom and have no problem finding your way in the countryside, with or without a map. When you arrive at a village in the Principalities, you receive a warm welcome from the local peasants and can readily find someone willing to give you a good meal and a bed for the night. Suggested Characteristics Haunted villagers are shaped by dark events in their past, and the loved ones they lost still haunt their dreams every night. Sometimes the tragedy they experienced leads them to seek revenge on the vampires and other dark forces that cause so much misery, and to fight for freedom and for the common people against oppression. Family, friends, home, and village are most often important bonds to haunted villagers. d8 Personality Traits 1 I’m a survivor. Nothing life throws at me now can be worse than what I’ve already endured. 2 I speak my mind, and that sometimes causes offense. 3 I’m not cutting my hair or shaving my beard until I’ve avenged my family. 4 I eat heartily and belch loudly afterward in appreciation. You never know where your next meal is coming from. 5 I don’t trust people who don’t work with their hands. 6 I may never be a hero, but I’ll never be a coward. 7 I am driven by wanderlust and always feel compelled to move on after a day or two in one place. 8 I’m always picking up odds and ends that I come across in my travels. You never know what might come in handy. d6 Ideal 1 Greater Good. It is our duty to make things better for those who are suffering. (Good) 2 Freedom.

(Any) d6 Bond 1 I’ll make sure no one else in my family dies a violent death. 2 The tools of my trade are my last connection to my previous life. I keep them to remind me of what I once was. 3 I will return to free the people of my village from the baron’s tyranny. 4 I carry my loved one’s journal in my breast pocket and read it every night. 5 I will make those who hurt my family suffer. 6 It should have been me that died that night and not my loved one. Their sacrifice drives me forward. d6 Flaw 1 My dreams are sometimes so terrifying I wake up screaming. 2 I feel guilty for abandoning my family and my home, but I couldn’t stay there a moment longer. 3 When I think about what I will do to the creature that killed my family, my fury is all-consuming. 4 I cannot trust anyone until they prove themselves worthy beyond all doubt. 5 I drink heavily to forget the bad things that happened. 6 I secretly yearn to become an elder.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Healer","description":"You have dedicated a great deal of your life to understanding the body, how to cure it and how to keep it healthy. You may be a priest in a temple, an apprentice under a physician or even a self-taught medic. You know how easy it is to cause damage, and in contrast how difficult it is to fix it. Your studies encouraged you to research and practice your expertise wherever your travels may take you to.

Feature: Medical Professional You have a reputation as a healer of the sick, and are often called upon by those who are suffering from disease or injuries. You can usually gain an audience with anyone who needs treatment — even if protocol would normally prevent you from doing so — simply by agreeing to offer your assistance. Additionally, you can acquire shelter, food and even payment in settlements in exchange for offering to help a community with your expertise as a medic. Payment may not always be monetary, and depending on the economic state of the settlement it may not even be valuable.

Whenever you heal someone, a faint aura of the same color as your magic trails behind them for a moment. Suggested Characteristics Healers are defined by the focus on their work and attention to details. Because so many of the illnesses they treat often have similar symptoms, they are careful about the things they say and the questions they ask, always looking to gather precise and accurate information. They tend towards cleanliness and organization, as they need to keep their tools sterile and their supplies ready at all times. d8 Personality Trait 1 I prefer to save violence as a last resort. 2 I keep all of my possessions meticulously clean, and I hate any kind of filth. 3 I make incredibly poor jokes in an attempt to put others at ease. 4 I have many stories of seeing serious injuries. Sometimes a bit too...graphic. 5 I try to be as honest as possible. Being transparent is the best way to make a diagnosis after all. 6 I present everything I say as a guess or estimate so that I don’t look foolish if I turn out to be wrong. 7 I try to make conversation at the most inopportune times.

The Hellriders get their name from the brave cavalry that rode into the Nine Hells alongside the angel Zariel long ago. Today, these honorable riders fiercely defend Elturel atop mighty destriers and dutifully give ten percent of all earnings to the city’s coffers. Hellriders are easily recognizable due to their crimson and white armor and banners bearing the crest of Elturgard: the sun and the smaller, blazing Companion. Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Persuasion Languages: One of your choice Tool Proficiencies: Your choice of gaming set or musical instrument Equipment: One set of traveler’s clothes, a signet, a banner or seal with the crest of Elturgard, and a pouch containing 9 gp Feature: Respected Rider As a Hellrider, you are well-respected within Elturgard, and your heraldry is recognized throughout Faerûn. While in the Kingdom of Two Suns—encompassing Elturel, Triel, Scornubel, Soubar, and Berdusk—you can commandeer fresh mounts for you and your party. Typically, this occurs at outposts such as Windstream Lodge, but Hellriders and their companions are held in high regard and can resupply in any Elturgard settlement. Use the warhorse statistics for your mount and the riding horse statistics for those of your comrades. Hellriders traditionally operate within Elturgard, but on occasion the High Watcher or High Rider has sent Hellriders to other lands. Outside of the Elturgard, you can purchase non-exotic mounts from merchants sympathetic to the Hellriders at half price. Advancement Once they have completed their training, a warrior is inducted into the Hellriders through a special ceremony held by the High Rider and an elected priest of Helm known as the High Observer. Once initiated, a Hellrider can continue to prove themselves by advancing in rank. Hellrider Ranks Rank Name Role 1 Hoof Knight 2 Quarter Standard Bearer 3 Stallion Under-Marshal 4 Destrier Marshal 5 High Rider Commander Suggested Characteristics A Hellrider’s rigorous training produces an equestrian knight with a reputation for discipline, vigilance, and fury. Though each rider may seem identical when galloping across the hills of Elturgard, these high expectations can have profound effects on an individual Hellrider’s outlook. d8 Persona lity Trait 1 I tell other Hellriders’ stories as if they were my own. 2 My armor must remain spotless so that it may reflect the light of the Companion. 3 My horse goes wherever I do. 4 Only death frees a Hellrider from their post. Some say I welcome it. 5 I was a hellion growing up. I often take the time to educate (or chastise) children I meet in my adventures. 6 When I’m on the job, I never crack a smile. 7 I reserve eye contact for those I respect. 8 I haven’t cut my hair since I joined the Hellriders. d6 Ideal 1 Kindness. The light of the Companion burns bright within my soul. (Good) 2 Justice. By upholding the law, we defend the rights of all. (Lawful) 3 Fury. I am relentless in the pursuit and destruction of my enemies. (Evil) 4 Freedom. Everyone should be free to pursue their livelihood. (Chaotic) 5 Loyalty. When I make an ally, it’s for life. (Any) 6 Nation. My city, kingdom, and its people are all that matter. (Any) d6 Bond 1 So long as the Companion burns over Elturel, there is still hope for Faerûn. 2 My name and deeds will be immortalized in the songs of the Hellriders. 3 I idolize the High Rider and dutifully follow their commands. 4 I have a mighty steed that I prize above all others. 5 I’m not the first Hellrider in my family, and I won’t be the last. 6 I have sworn the strict oaths of the Creed Resolute. I vow to uphold the laws of Elturgard, protect its citizens, and serve the greater good. d6 Flaw 1 I am always honest with those of higher authority. 2 When I’m off duty, I am somewhat inattentive. 3 Though I have sworn to vanquish evil, I secretly fear it. 4 I trained for years to be a Hellrider. I have little patience for those who are privileged by birth. 5 I am suspicious of those who extend offers to me. 6 I was never supposed to be a Hellrider.

You can work with your DM to determine the exact nature of your seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below to determine the reason behind your seclusion. d8 Life of Seclusion 1 I was searching for spiritual enlightenment. 2 I was partaking of communal living in accordance with the dictates of a religious order. 3 I was exiled for a crime I didn't commit. 4 I retreated from society after a life-altering event. 5 I needed a quiet place to work on my art, literature, music, or manifesto. 6 I needed to comm⁠une with n⁠ature, far from civilization. 7 I was the caretaker of an ancient ruin or relic. 8 I was a pilgrim in search of a person, place, or relic of spiritual significance. Feature: Discovery The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign. Suggested Characteristics Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society. d8 Personality Trait 1 I’ve been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt. 2 I am utterly serene, even in the face of disaster. 3 The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom. 4 I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer. 5 I’m oblivious to etiquette and social expectations. 6 I connect everything that happens to me to a grand, cosmic plan. 7 I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings. 8 I am working on a grand philosophical theory and love sharing my ideas. d6 Ideal 1 Greater Good.

(Any) d6 Bond 1 Nothing is more important than the other members of my hermitage, order, or association. 2 I entered seclusion to hide from the ones who might still be hunting me. I must someday confront them. 3 I’m still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion, and it still eludes me. 4 I entered seclusion because I loved someone I could not have. 5 Should my discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world. 6 My isolation gave me great insight into a great evil that only I can destroy. d6 Flaw 1 Now that I’ve returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much. 2 I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell. 3 I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy. 4 I let my need to win arguments overshadow friendships and harmony. 5 I’d risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge. 6 I like keeping secrets and won’t share them with anyone. Other Hermits This hermit background assumes a contemplative sort of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of other people, look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte might be what you’re looking for.

I have learned to appreciate the land on which I live, and will protect it and its inhabitants. Someone attacked me while I tried to save others, but got away. I will find and I will end them. Flaws I am overprotective. I will not allow anything bad happening to those I am responsible for. I get agitated easily. Even at first signs of danger, I feel like I am back in the last moments of the apocalypse. I have survived, and I am going to enjoy the life I was granted. Give me all the pleasures the world has to offer! For me, the battle for survival never ended. I constantly look for danger, and even seek it actively. Seeing so much suffering and death was more than I could handle. Today, I bottle up my emotions, so they can't overwhelm me.

Its castles are built into the Kaiu Wall itself, and its training grounds overlook swaths of the twisted realm beyond. The family’s task is an eternal vigil to keep the Empire safe from unthinkable horrors as its founder once did. However, unlike the divine warrior who founded the family, the members of the family today are not demigods but mortals, and every victory comes at a price in supplies, morale, and lives. This harsh responsibility makes many members of the Hida family exceedingly pragmatic, with little time for the polite but deadly maneuverings of other courts. If that time could be spent studying the weaknesses of monsters or experimenting with new battle tactics that might reduce the rate of attrition in future engagements, most Hida would prefer not to waste it on frivolous political posturing.

You got from day to day, maybe even had some success. But when things got difficult, you had a tendency to just move on. This gave you a certain freedom, but also a lack of security - financially as well as emotionally. When the apocalypse came, you did what you do best: You ran. Fortunately, in the right direction. Be it fate or luck, you ended up in a region that was saved by the champion of your world. But since then, you never really stopped running. Travelling from town to town, maybe even from country to country, you only look forward. The past just hasn't much to offer for you. Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, Survival Tool Proficiencies and Languages: Gaming Kit, and one language of your choice Equipment: A pouch containing 5 gp A set of traveler's clothes A Dungeoneer's Pack or an Explorer's Pack City hunch: Whenever you come into a new town or city, you quickly notice the most important buildings - or have a hunch on where to find them. From the guard's tower to the best inn (whatever that means to you), you know where to look for such places (and how to avoid them). Suggested characteristics: You burn the bridges behind you. Most people don't matter much to you, even though you might have a small number of close friends. That doesn't necessarily mean you don't care about people, in general, just not so much about specific individuals. You've seen some bad things, so looking forward is usually the better option - the future is, at least, something you can shape. If only by heading into a new direction. Traits The goal of life is happiness. For every decision I make, I ask myself: Will this make me happy? The past is a haunted place. I prefer not to look at it, and run away from everything that reminds me of the past. I've never had a lot of friends, and I never felt close to my family. I learned to rely on myself. I don't trust easily, but also don't expect others to trust me. I'm good at social situations. I know what to do and what to say - I just don't feel what I pretend to feel. I'm not running away. I'm running towards a better life. I'm used to other people only helping me in exchange for something. I usually don't wait until they ask. Let's just get it over with. I'm a thrillseeker. Every new adventure makes me forget I might miss something in my life. Ideals Happiness. All I want in life is happiness - for me and for everyone else. (Good) Adaptation. Wherever I go, I act as the locals do. I'm only a guest, and I always respect the local laws. (Lawful) Change. Nobody should be forced into a life they don't want. I'll offer my help to anyone looking for a life change. (Chaotic) Selfishness. Most people I meet, I won't ever see again. I try to get as much out of others as I can. (Evil) Avoidance. I try to never stay too long in one place. Things get complicated when you stay too long. (Neutral) Curiosity. Why look back, when there's a whole new world to explore? Curiosity drives me forward, every single day. (Any) Bonds I had one person (or animal) in my life that I trusted. I have no idea what happened to them during the apocalypse, and I think of them often. My nomadic life really started after one heated discussion with an important person in my life. Things got so bad that I left, and never returned. During the apocalypse, someone helped me survive. They just did it, without asking anything in return. And I can't stop thinking about it. I have fallen in love, but never confessed it to the person. They're still alive, and I am still in love. I love stories, and regularly take my time to escape into them. Whether told by a bard or written in a book, I can always enjoy a new tale. When I travel, I try to have at least one novel with me. Sometimes, burning a bridge doesn't fully work out. There's someone I have wronged in the past, and they are still looking for me. Flaws I have a variety of learned roles to interact with other people. Only a few that are close to me know my real self. When under pressure, I tell people whatever I think they want to hear, even if it's a lie. This includes social pressure, and also happens among friends. I have an addiction. But it's not a problem. I can stop whenever I want to. Seriously! I can be ruthless. When you don't get attached to people, it can be easy to forget they have feelings, too. I'm lonely. Even if I tell myself I don't need anyone else, deep down I do. I fulfill this need with superficial affairs and meaningless \"friendships\". I'm socially awkward. I never really learned how to interact with others. And I always feel like they know I don't know what I'm doing.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Hiruma Family - Crab Clan","description":"Having lost their lands to the spread of the Shadowlands centuries ago, the Hiruma family does little in the way of administration of territory or collection of taxes. Instead, members of this family train and serve as the eyes and ears of the Crab beyond the Wall, warning of attacks and staging spoiling raids when a particularly powerful horror begins to gather an army around itself. It is a desperate, dangerous task, but the warnings facilitated by the skills of the Hiruma allow the Crab to respond quickly to any threat, and their proactive strikes can save hundreds of lives. Due to the ceaseless danger of the Shadowlands, the Hiruma rotate between service beyond the Wall and service inside the Empire, where they function as scouts, messengers, and bodyguards. The Hiruma School teaches its adherents to fight in light armor rather than the heavy plate favored by the Hida, relying instead on speed and precision, for when facing a monster the size of a building in open ground, armor avails you little. Skill Proficiencies: Survival, choose one other Dexterity-based skill (Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth). Tool Proficiencies: Chemist’s kit, dice and cup. Weapon Proficiencies: Wakizashi. Languages: You can read, sign, speak, and write Rokugani. You can also speak and sign battle argot and Ivindi, one of the languages of the Ivory Kingdoms. Equipment: Traveling clothes or unremarkable garb, wakizashi, one finger of jade, chemist’s kit, dice and cup, and 3 gp. Background Feature: Know Your Enemy You grew up in the penumbra of the Shadowlands, and the threat it poses is second nature to you, granting you the following benefits: You know the signals with flares, flags, and smoke used along the Carpenter Wall, along with each one’s meaning. You can identify common Shadowlands creatures, such as the undead and lesser horrors, and you know how to dispatch them. You grew up hearing stories and songs of heroes who faced greater evils still, such as oni and Lost champions, and might have even seen one on the battlefield. You know all too well the whispered promises of power that pervade the Shadowlands and how to steel your soul against their call.

Hiruma Skirmisher School Quick Build If you want to quickly build a character trained in the Hiruma Skirmisher school of warfare, make Dexterity and Wisdom your highest ability scores, and Constitution next to keep you in the fight.

You lost control of yourself to a creature more powerful than you, known as your “rider”. You have more control of yourself now, but it may still influence your decisions, or you may still be a victim of stigma from the things you did under its control. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Perception Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit and one instrument or gaming set. Languages: Two of your choice; your native language and one gained from the creature you were host to. Equipment: A book of supernatural creatures with pages ripped out, a piece of jewelry that doesn’t belong to you, two sets of common clothes, and a pouch containing 5gp. An Uninvited Guest What creature or force took control of you for its schemes? How did you get free? Work with your GM to determine exact details of your rider and your relationship to it, or roll on the table below. D8 Rider 1 Naivety or desperation drove me to attempt to summon a fiend, which tricked me into becoming its puppet. 2 While exterminating an unknown aberration, it implanted a piece of itself in me, which took me over. 3 A spirit escaped an exorcism by possessing my body. 4 A lich implanted a piece of its soul within me to preserve its own life, and its will overpowered mine. 5 I inhaled spores of a sentient fungal colony, which infected my brain and took control. 6 After a severe injury, I fell into a deathlike slumber, and a revenant inhabited my body as its vessel. 7 An elder genie, stricken with the ennui of immortality, took over my body as a flight of fancy. 8 A powerful celestial, believing I was destined to cause great strife, overtook me in the interest of the “greater good”. Feature: Monstrous Connection Your experiences with your rider grant you an unusual insight into how supernatural creatures think and behave. Note down the creature type of your rider (aberration, fiend, etc.). When confronted with a creature of this type, you can communicate simple ideas with it, even if it couldn’t normally communicate. If you communicate with such a creature as part of making a first impression while not in combat, the creature’s starting disposition is one step better than normal, from hostile to neutral, or neutral to friendly. Suggested Characteristics Being a host to a supernatural creature doesn’t have to define your character, but it should definitely have an effect on them. Here are some traits to flesh out the person they’ve become. D8 Personality Trait 1 I am largely unfazed by the supernatural, having been dealing with it for so long. 2 I never pass up an opportunity to learn about strange creatures and phenomena. 3 Whenever something interesting happens, I keep extensive notes on it, for fear my memory might fail me later. 4 I take opportunities to “test” my autonomy through chaotic and unpredictable gestures and actions. 5 I love making friends and meeting new people, since I’ve been restricted from doing so. 6 I sometimes come across as naive due to having been robbed of opportunities to grow. 7 My mannerisms come across as unusual or alien to common folk. 8 I often say things aloud that I meant to only say in my head without noticing. D6 Ideal 1 Freedom. Impinging on any creature’s autonomy is a cruel business. (Neutral) 2 Control. Servitude is the only serenity anyone can ever know. (Evil) 3 Authority. The word of greater powers must be observed. (Lawful) 4 Loyalty. No one is an island; we must act to serve others. (Good) 5 Change. Hierarchies that give one control over another must be destroyed. (Chaotic) 6 Survival. I fought for everything I have, and it’s up to others to do the same for themselves. (Any) D6 Bond 1 I’m still on rather good terms with my rider, either out of sympathy or familiarity. 2 I want to destroy my rider, and its kin. I will never forgive what was taken from me. 3 I have a high bounty on my head in some places for the actions of my rider. 4 A friend risked their life to give me my autonomy back, and I owe them dearly. 5 I have a list of people my rider wronged who I’m trying to make amends to. 6 I still carry out the work of my rider, but in my own way, now. D6 Flaw 1 I often try to “make up for lost time” by indulging too deeply in the pleasures of life. 2 I don’t like making decisions for myself, and will try to defer to others even when I’m the expert. 3 I can’t stand being alone; it feels wrong after having another consciousness with me for so long. 4 I take foolish risks with my body sometimes because I forget it’s no longer preserved by a powerful being. 5 My conscience is nearly nonexistent, as my only guiding role model was an alien intellect. 6 I still don’t really take my autonomy seriously, and don’t feel responsible for anything I do or that happens to me. Variant: Escape You may potentially have managed to purge your rider from your body in your travels. Here are some potential ways that could have happened. D4 Escape 1 A powerful ritual drove the creature out, nearly killing you in the process. 2 With years of planning and preparation, you were able to outsmart your rider and reassert control. 3 The rider’s work was complete, and it departed willingly, leaving you to clean up its mess. 4 Your rider abandoned your body when you were killed by adventurers, who later resurrected you.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Lone Colossus Games","book":"Injuries and Vile Deeds"},{"name":"House Agent","description":"You have sworn fealty to a dragonmarked house.

Not so for the formidable Badger Clan, which is situated in the north of Rokugan and protects a set of key mountain passes and trails. From childhood, members of the Ichirō family are taught to be watchful and ready at all times to warn the rest of the clan of invading armies. Indeed, over the centuries, the Badger Clan has sparred with various foreign forces making military expeditions into Rokugan from the west, often driving off much larger forces with their mastery of the terrain. As such, visitors to the clan might expect to find hardworking if rustic warriors whose domain offers little in the way of hospitality or entertainment. This is where the Badger consistently surprise outsiders, as they have a great love of the wrestling art of sumai, produce numerous crafts including some of the highest-grade silk in Rokugan, and their Fureshu family’s brewers distill saké as delicious as anything made in the heartland.

Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does. The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item’s history and importance. For instance, the object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met. When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your inheritance right away.

At the GM’s discretion, these restrictions can be lifted in certain locations.

Staying safe never allows you to see the wonders of the world.(Chaotic) 6 Selfish. We must make sure we bargain for what our skills are worth; people don’t value what you give away for free.

Ever since you were young you have seen marvelous creations that inspired you. Magically-fueled vehicles, golems, firearms and every piece of magitech you can imagine, these all left you in awe. Enough that you sought to learn how to make them yourself. And now you are seeking to forge your own path, through adventure. What inspired you to do so?

They rule great underwater cities, which only a few humans are ever lucky enough to visit due to the logistical difficulties of keeping a human both underwater and alive for long periods of time. However, they often visit the cities of humans, trading with the various fractious kingdoms that, in the eyes of the naga, seem to rise and fall in days. The naga as a whole generally stay out of the political affairs of humans when they can avoid it, but they have been known to send warriors to assist the Yodha of the Ghostlands in fighting rakshasa and other horrors that would defile the lands of human and naga alike. Individual naga sometimes do become embroiled in human affairs, though this is generally seen as risky behavior due to the short time horizon on which most humans seem to think and operate. In the Ivory Kingdoms, most naga do not bother to charm humans with an illusion of a human form, and most humans are not especially surprised to see naga going about their business.

Though you’re likely to begin your career as a mere attendant, you can aspire to become a skilled mage or alchemist, a laboratory supervisor, or even a flamethrower-wielding scorchbringer tasked with defending Izzet laboratories. The Izzet are obsessive, brilliant, inspired, and an unpredictable force of chaos in Ravnica, and you epitomize all of those qualities. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Investigation Languages: Choose one of Draconic, Goblin, or Vedalken Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools Equipment: An Izzet insignia, one set of artisan’s tools, the charred and twisted remains of a failed experiment, a hammer, a block and tackle, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins) Feature: Urban Infrastructure The popular conception of the Izzet League is based on mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and explosive blasts. Much of that perception is accurate, but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of construction and architecture—primarily in crafting the infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running water, levitating platforms, and other magical and technological wonders.

For example, when you open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles. If you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear. The chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature.

Both occupations are considered useful tools for the ruling class and citizens. The ruling classes use them for propaganda, while citizens need them to learn about their cities and community.

The rookies usually work as assistants, reporters, and artists (drawing crime scenes and portraits) in their first few years.

All my creations include intricate designs that are both functional and exquisite. 5 The winds and seas of the Expanse speak to me. My whispered responses have labeled me a weather witch, a moniker I wear with pride. 6 I remain unfazed by even the most shocking situations, facing them with a strange, calm detachment. 7 Becoming a skilled magewright was not a path I chose.

I am transfixed by language, often overanalyzing other people’s speech to find meaning where there is none. 5 Protection. I believe that the planar portals are incursions endangering my native plane. With the knowledge I gain, I seek to repair these rifts. 6 A Dream. When I was young, a dream spoke to me of another elemental plane.

My volatile nature makes those around me nervous and stressed. 6 I suffer from bouts of memory loss.

If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your comm⁠oner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on). As an emble⁠m of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart—in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could be your bond.) You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them. Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you. Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the comm⁠on people regard them? What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family? Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symb⁠ol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family? These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign. Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp Feature: Retainers If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege. You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused. Suggested Characteristics Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble. d8 Personality Trait 1 My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world. 2 The com⁠mon folk love me for my kindness and generosity. 3 No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses. 4 I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions. 5 I don’t like to get my hands dirty, and I won’t be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations. 6 Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood. 7 My favor, once lost, is lost forever. 8 If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields. d6 Ideal 1 Respect. Respect is due to me because of my position, but all people regardless of station deserve to be treated with dignity. (Good) 2 Responsibility. It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine. (Lawful) 3 Independence. I must prove that I can handle myself without the coddling of my family. (Chaotic) 4 Power. If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do. (Evil) 5 Family. Blood runs thicker than water. (Any) 6 Noble Obligation. It is my duty to protect and care for the people beneath me. (Good) d6 Bond 1 I will face any challenge to win the approval of my family. 2 My house’s alliance with another noble family must be sustained at all costs. 3 Nothing is more important than the other members of my family. 4 I am in love with the heir of a family that my family despises. 5 My loyalty to my sovereign is unwavering. 6 The com⁠mon folk must see me as a hero of the people. d6 Flaw 1 I secretly believe that everyone is beneath me. 2 I hide a truly scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever. 3 I too often hear veiled insults and threats in every word addressed to me, and I’m quick to anger. 4 I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures. 5 In fact, the world does revolve around me. 6 By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my family.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Player's Handbook"},{"name":"Knight of Solamnia","description":"Prerequisite: Dragonlance Campaign You have trained to be a valorous warrior known as a Knight of Solamnia.

In addition, the Knights of Solamnia provide you free, modest lodging and food at any of their fortresses or encampments. Building a Knight of Solamnia Character Any class that has martial prowess can be a good fit in the Knights of Solamnia. Fighters and paladins make up the bulk of the knighthood’s forces. Clerics (often with the War domain) can also be found among the knights’ ranks. For a more unusual take on a Knight of Solamnia character, consider playing a bard of the College of Valor (or the College of Swords from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything ) or a barbarian devoted to the ideals of the nature god Habbakuk (perhaps adopting the Path of the Zealot from Xanathar’s Guide to Ev erything ).

The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities. Though the term “knight” conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don’t restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren’t limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order’s cause. The “Knightly Orders of Faerûn” below details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to. Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or musical instrument Languages: One of your choice Equipment: One set of traveler’s clothes, a signet, banner or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp Knightly Orders of Faerûn Many who rightfully call themselves “knight” earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor’s Eternal Order or Mystra’s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word “knight” think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations. Knights of the Unicorn. The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur’s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue’s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses. Knights of Myth Drannor. Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they’ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest. Knights of the Silver Chalice. The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe’s ethos is the nobility’s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown. Feature: Knightly Regard You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community—whether a lone settlement or a great nation—that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals. This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order. Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight’s ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one’s order.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide"},{"name":"Knotted Tails Tribe - Non-Human","description":"The Shadowlands is a harsh environment even for beings immune to its corrupting influence, filled with cunning horrors and ravening undead. Some nezumi tribes have dedicated warriors among them, trained to fight these threats for the tribe from birth, but this is not the case for the Knotted Tails. Being a relatively small tribe of a few dozen, most members of the tribe take on different roles as necessary, and no roles are considered demeaning. Every Knotted Tails nezumi is thus not only a guardian, but also a scavenger, lookout, healer, and pup-sitter. Though their martial discipline is somewhat informal, many wear armor constructed from scraps of metal and wood, or scavenged from the dead. In recent years, some among the Knotted Tails have even become enamored with the valor of the humans they have seen face terrible odds in the Shadowlands, and have sought out any information they can on human martial virtue from the members of the Crab Clan who visit their lands.

As such, you have a different way of understanding the world than most humans, granting you the following benefits: You know the history of your own culture and how it has interacted with other groups across the centuries. You know a great deal about passing through regions that human inhabitants of Rokugan generally view as impassable in relative safety, such as through the spirit realms, the Shadowlands, or the Shinomen Forest. You can identify the dangers and areas of safety in these places. You instinctively recognize the taboos of spirits and otherworldly beings when visiting their domains, though you do not necessarily have all the information needed to deal with them. You know about the various realms below, beside, and above, and can recognize the common markers of their inhabitants.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Edge Studio","book":"Adventures in Rokugan"},{"name":"Krakovan Rebel","description":"You were a loyal citizen and supporter of King Eynryk, rightful ruler of the Electoral Kingdom of Krakova, when the undead army of the Principalities invaded. Still living within the borders of the Province of Krakovar, your loyalties now lie with the exiled Queen Urzula, and you despise the vampires who conquered your homeland. You have joined the ranks of the resistance to Morgau’s rule, taking part in ambushes and small acts of sabotage against the undead. You may have rescued innocents enslaved as thralls or due to be sacrificed on the altars of the Blood Goddess, and smuggled them over the border into New Wolfheim or Dornig. Perhaps you denounced the government during a service to Mavros or stole coins from the tax man’s coffers to buy weapons for the struggle. You know the undead rulers are outnumbered nearly eight to one and are beset by enemies on all sides, so you are hopeful that they can be overthrown.

Suggested Characteristics The rebel numbers include a mixed bag of diverse personalities and character traits. Some fighters experienced the horror of seeing their families killed by the undead and have sworn to carry out swift and violent revenge. Others adopt a more considered approach, acting with subtlety and only after careful planning. Resistance fighters are dedicated to the overthrow of the vampires and the restoration of the Electoral Kingdom, and this is nearly always reflected in their ideals and bonds. d8 Personality Trait 1 I pray to Wotan every night to free our land from the eternal night that has fallen upon it. 2 I love the smell of alchemist’s fire in the morning. 3 I’m happy to talk to people from all walks of life, as long as they share my belief in freedom. 4 Now is the time for action, not words. 5 I prefer to think things through before acting. 6 I would gladly die for my comrades, just as Sister Adelind did at Yarosbirg. 7 However bleak things get, there is always hope. 8 I don’t trust people I don’t know well.

The Kuni family has an extremely unusual structure, even for a family built around maintaining religious traditions. While most members of the family serve in administrative roles or train as warriors, those with the knack for speaking to spirits are trained not by a series of teachers alongside fellow students, but by a single mentor, with whom they are apprenticed. This means that there is little hierarchy or accountability within the so-called Kuni Purifier School: each teacher is expected to devise their own curriculum and methodology, with only occasional gatherings by the entire group to share findings. As a result, some Kuni are willing to delve far deeper into the dark secrets of the Shadowlands than is advisable.

Languages: You can read, sign, speak, and write Rokugani. You can also read Kuni ciphers, a series of symbolic codes used to conceal dangerous secret knowledge that members of the Kuni tradition encounter. Equipment: Sanctified vestments or unremarkable garb, wakizashi, one finger of jade, alchemist’s kit, and 5 gp. Background Feature: Know Your Enemy You grew up in the penumbra of the Shadowlands, and the threat it poses is second nature to you, granting you the following benefits: You know the signals with flares, flags, and smoke used along the Carpenter Wall, along with each one’s meaning. You can identify common Shadowlands creatures, such as the undead and lesser horrors, and you know how to dispatch them. You grew up hearing stories and songs of heroes who faced greater evils still, such as oni and Lost champions, and might have even seen one on the battlefield. You know all too well the whispered promises of power that pervade the Shadowlands and how to steel your soul against their call. Suggested Feats A set of suggested feats that reflect the Crab Clan’s traditions and training can be found in chapter 5. Kuni Purifier School Quick Build If you want to quickly build a character trained in the Kuni Purifier school of rituals, make Intelligence and Dexterity your highest ability scores. Begin in the bushi class for one level to improve your durability and gain access to martial weapons. Then switch to the ritualist class, selecting the Elementalist archetype at 2nd level. Focus on selecting invocations that inflict negative conditions on Lost creatures, like jade strike and Lady Sun’s smile , and select either Earth or Fire for your elemental alignment. Switch to shinobi for one level to get the Merciless Strikes, Expert Prowler, and Ninjutsu features to help you in clandestine ventures.

The technology level of these planets range from as primitive as spears and bone tools, to as advanced as modern Earth. However, without the innovation of faster-than-light travel or the intervention of a galactic faction, the peoples of these planets will never join the galactic community. Low-worlders find themselves far from home through a variety of different means. Sometimes, their journeys are purposeful, a planet's first rocketborne steps to the stars above, but most often low-worlders stumble into the wider universe by sheer accident. Mishaps with powerful dimensional or teleportation magic, abductions, and stowing away on visiting spacecraft are all common stories among low-worlders. Universally, low-worlders are foreigners in the 'verse, discombobulated for several years as they learn the basics of their new surroundings. The dizzying array of races baffles them and the mundane prevalence of spacecraft and other technology astounds them. Despite their naivety with technology and galactic culture, low-worlders often possess finely honed skills forgotten by much of the wider 'verse: you can find no better tracker, fletcher, cobbler, or blacksmith than those from the low worlds.

Suggested Characteristics Low-worlders are as diverse as the worlds they hail from, but all are strangers to the 'verse.

But whatever your origin, your interests and pursuits brought you to the hallowed halls of Tal’Dorei’s highest place of learning, where you soaked in every lesson you could, hoping to better make your mark on the world. (Or at least you pretended to. Even at the Lyceum, every class has its slackers.) Eventually, though, the call to adventure pulled you from your studies, and you now face the challenge of keeping up with your education even as the tides of destiny threaten to sweep you away. You might have come to the Lyceum to better research and understand the history and lore of Exandria and the lands you call home. Perhaps you sought a future here as a professor—or you might hope to do so still. You could also have been drawn by the promise of prosperity in politics, learning the inner workings of government and alliances to better position yourself as a future writer of history. Or perhaps your knack for the arcane inspired you to attend the Lyceum to refine your spellcraft, following in the footsteps of some of the finest wizards to ever practice the arts of magic. When you choose this background, you could be either an active student seeking adventures for your own research, or a graduated alumnus. With a little modification, you could easily be a professor as well. Skill Proficiencies: Your choice of two of the following: Arcana, History, or Persuasion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a student uniform, a writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a penknife), and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Academic Requisition You’ve cleared enough lessons—and have gained an ally or two among the staff—to enable access to certain private areas within the Lyceum and other allied universities. Whenever you’re on Lyceum grounds or at another major academic institution, you can requisition any set of tools found in the fifth edition rules. Each set of tools is magically marked to sound an alarm if they are removed from the university’s grounds. When you seek services such as spellcasting from an NPC at the Alabaster Lyceum or a related institution, you can use those services at a 25 percent discount, at the GM’s discretion. Suggested Characteristics The Alabaster Lyceum accepts students of all major trades, the fine arts, and the magical arts. Pupils talented and privileged enough to be accepted travel to Emon from all over Tal’Dorei, seeking to study among some of the greatest minds and most talented arcanists in the land. If you came from a smaller city, a rural area, or Tal’Dorei’s relatively uncharted wilderness, studying at the Lyceum might have left you with a sense of culture shock, for good or for ill. Your bond is likely associated with your goals as a student or graduate. Your ideal probably involves your hopes in using the knowledge you’ve gained at the Lyceum, and your travels as an adventurer, to tailor the world to your liking. Lyceum Scholar Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I can’t believe I’m here! At the Alabaster Lyceum. Oh, gods, I’ve dreamed of this my whole life, and now I’m here! 2 I can’t believe I squandered all the opportunities I had at school. I was supposed to be learning good stuff, but I wasted it all daydreaming about fighting monsters. 3 Every night at school, I’d knock back a couple of meads and read with my pals! Just a bunch of nerds having fun, and I loved it. 4 Everyone at school was such a stick in the mud. Dressing the same, listening to the same bards…ugh, it’s sad. Just be yourself. 5 I’m happiest when I’ve got my little party with me. At school, it was like we were a squad of heroes, slaying projects like monsters. 6 I’d really rather you didn’t bother me. Can’t you see I’m studying here? 7 I don’t care. I just don’t care about it all. The dates I had to memorize, the formulae I learned…I just want to run away and live! 8 I’m just…tired. All the time. Oh, adventuring, sure, that’s fine, as long as I can find time to…nap…goodnight. Lyceum Scholar Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Preparedness. I can’t go out into the world unless I know what I’m up against. Study first, act later. (Neutral) 2 Stardom. Having a team is good and all, but you can’t win a game of ball without the star charger, and you know that’s me. (Evil) 3 Individuality. The world keeps us down by trying to put us all into little boxes. I’m tired of living in my box, and I don’t care what you think about it. (Chaotic) 4 Purpose. I study because there are things I need to know. I’ll find my place in the world, and I’ll make the world better. (Good) 5 Code of Conduct. The student code is there to benefit all students, you know. It’s the same for laws! (Lawful) 6 Recreation. All this studying crap wasn’t worth anything if you weren’t partying when you were done. Meet me down at the tavern, okay? (Chaotic) Lyceum Scholar Bonds d6 Bond 1 I came to the Lyceum with no one, but I fell in love with the city of Emon. I’ve finally found a place that feels like home! 2 Most of my professors drove me to frustration, but there’s one who was kind and wise. I know they’ll always have my back. 3 My family saved every copper piece to give me the opportunities I have now. I can’t let them down. 4 I came to the Lyceum with a childhood friend, but we’ve long been drifting apart. 5 Discovery is the only thing that matters to me. The topic doesn’t matter. Books keep me company on my loneliest days. 6 The Lyceum is my life. I’d give up anything—everything—to protect it from harm. Lyceum Scholar Flaws d6 Flaw 1 The Lyceum taught me to never want to leave my room. The campus was so huge, and the crowds were so horrible. 2 You think you’re so great just because you’ve got muscles, and endurance, and…shut up! Read a book sometime! 3 Huh? What? Sorry, I was thinking about a test I need to retake when I get back to school…. 4 I spent too much time studying. Now I don’t have any friends. 5 If you don’t match my aesthetic, I’m not interested in you. We can work together, but we won’t be friends. Got it? 6 I’m always striving for perfection. I got top of my class, sure, but only with a 98 average. And that’s. Not.

Utilizing the aether by drinking tiny amounts of the poisonous liquid, these spellcasters enter what they call “wraith dreams” - vivid hallucinations believed to be eerie premonitions of the future, often involving impending doom and disaster. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Insight Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of common clothes, a small book of arcane lore, a tiny vial of liquid aether, and a pouch containing 10 gp Bonus Trait : Tireless Officer Progression: If you use the optional Seafarer Advancement Rules (see chapter 7), you increase your officer station rank by one in your choice of quartermaster or surgeon Feature: Wraith Dreams Imbibing small quantities of aether, you can induce a state of lucid dreaming called wraith dreams, which gift you with visions of the future. Once a day, these dreams grant you advantage on a single knowledge check. However, if you drink more than a mouthful of aether, you are still subject to the harmful effects of aether poisoning. Suggested Characteristics Mage Craft Dissidents are secretive by design, often thought fools or deemed too dangerous. Generally, being followers of time, they seek to hide in plain sight, waiting for their visions to be proven right. Personality Trait d8 Personality 1 I believe everything is interconnected and I look for ways to find my connections to everything I encounter. 2 I view time as a false construct and ignore demands to delay or rush any action. 3 Having seen visions of the dismal future, I work tirelessly to save the world from this horror. 4 Only the most powerful wielders of the arcane should be allowed to use aether. It disgusts me to see others use it flippantly. 5 I try to appear more intelligent than I am. I overuse metaphors – often incorrectly. 6 Being the center of attention terrifies me. Mice are louder than I am, and I speak in the softest of tones. 7 I am harshly rigid in my life. Everything has a purpose and must be planned out exactly. 8 Concerned with being misunderstood due to my speech, I speak slowly and overexplain things. Ideal d6 Ideal 1 Prevent Catastrophe. Our understanding of the Starlight Sea is flawed. We must learn its true purpose before it consumes us. 2 Nature. True magical power is found in the verdant reaches of the wilds. We must preserve these spaces before all magic is lost. 3 Ancestors. The spirits of our loved ones flow around. I wish to understand these spirits and bring them peace. 4 Education. I work tirelessly to educate those around me about the sorrows and pain of technology. 5 Self-Improvement. I seek to harness the echoes of the world that flow through time and space. 6 Longevity. Time tears away cherished memories and ravishes our bodies. Stalling its march drives my actions. Bond d6 Bond d6 Bond 1 In the mists of the Starlight Sea are indistinct shapes, lost souls killed by technology. I must put their souls at rest. 2 Elemental confluxes fascinate me, and I investigate their energies to harness them for my designs. 3 I am determined to rediscover lost magics and use them to displace technology. 4 The silence of space is frightening. Filling it with laughter and love drives me. 5 Magic speaks to us in dreams. I help others understand their dreams and navigate the mysteries they reveal. 6 We stopped caring about our histories, so we are doomed to repeat them. I will not make that mistake. I will record history as best as I can. Flaw d6 Flaw 1 Technology revolts me so strongly that I can act irrationally when forced to utilize it. 2 I have become reliant upon drinking aether. If I go too long without, I become erratic and unreliable. 3 I am unable to resist ceaselessly lecturing people about the dangers of technology. 4 Unsatisfied with being overlooked, my mannerisms and speech are overly exaggerated. 5 Wraith dreams have left me unable to tell reality from fantasy, leading me to make strange leaps in logic. 6 I casually disregard minor problems until they become overwhelming.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":32048},"publisher":"Ghostfire Gaming","book":"Aetherial Expanse Setting Guide"},{"name":"Mage of High Sorcery","description":"Prerequisite: Dragonlance Campaign Your talent for magic came to the attention of the Mages of High Sorcery, an organization of spellcasters that studies magic and prevents its misuse.

Your passion for studying magic has likely already predisposed you toward one of the organization’s three orders: the benevolent Order of the White Robes, the balance-pursuing Order of the Red Robes, or the ruthless Order of the Black Robes. In the world of Krynn, many refer to the Mages of High Sorcery as the Wizards of High Sorcery.

Under the Edicts of Lumen, mages are disinherited of any noble titles, and cannot own land.

Personality Trait (1d8) 1 I idolize one of the archmages of the Academy and hope to prove myself to them in time. 2 Nothing will get between me and my goals. When people say something I care about is impossible, I prove them wrong. 3 I am confident in my powers, and do not fear the horrors of Drakkenheim, for I can bend reality. 4 I am constantly reading books. The more knowledge I can obtain, the more I can outwit friends and foes alike. 5 I am a mage for hire and am not afraid to use my magic to get my hands dirty.

You can never regain your original form; for all intents and purposes, you are who you appear to be. You’re physically indistinguishable from them, and you have enough of their memories to fool even their family and friends. But you have the mind of a sahuagin, and you’re loyal to the Dominion. As a malenti, the first question is why the Dominion chose to replace this particular person, and how your mission relates to your activities as an adventurer. It’s possible that your only mission is to observe the dryskins and occasionally provide information to a sahuagin spymaster, or you might have a specific goal that drives your actions during your adventures. The Suggested Characteristics tables provide information about your mission. You’re physically identical to the creature you appear to be; you are an elf, or a kalashtar, or whatever race you replaced. It is up to you and your DM to decide how widespread malenti are in Khorvaire. It could be that the Dominion has placed many malenti in the Five Nations, or you might be one of the first. If this is the case, you may be the first malenti to duplicate a creature of this particular race or species. This could be particularly interesting with a kalashtar—you’ve inherited the spiritual bond with a quori, but what does that mean for you? Will the tie to the alien spirit change you? Similarly, if you possess a dragonmark, it seems to function normally, but will there be strange consequences in your future? It’s possible that your abilities reflect additional Dominion magebreeding or skills from your sahuagin side. If you’re a barbarian, does your rage reflect the blood frenzy of the sahuagin? If you’re a sorcerer, is spellcasting a gift your victim already possessed, or is it the result of sahuagin modification? And how has the integration of the new personality affected you? Are you still a true sahuagin, devoted to the Dominion? Or are the victim’s memories and experiences causing you to question your mission? Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Insight Tool Proficiencies: Thieves’ tools, poisoner’s kit, or forgery kit Languages: Sahuagin Equipment: A seashell, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a purse containing 30 gp, which can be used on equipment needed to match your victim’s identity Tour of Duty As a malenti, you’ve stolen the identity of a surface dweller. But when did this occur? How long have you been playing this role, and how comfortable are you with it? d6 Tour of Duty 1 You replaced your victim in their youth, and have a well-established relationship with family and friends. 2 You replaced your victim during the Last War, and may have fought in some of the battles yourself. 3 Your victim was lost at sea years ago and presumed dead; you have only just “miraculously” returned. 4 Your victim’s parents or siblings have also been replaced by malenti, and are serving as spies in a major city. 5 You replaced your victim only a month ago, as they returned from a trip to Stormreach. 6 You replaced your victim a year ago, but the circumstances were difficult and some of your old acquaintances are still suspicious. Feature: Stolen Identity As a malenti, you’ve assumed the identity and memories of a dryskin, and this provides you with the benefits of their position. Choose one of the following background features: By Popular Demand (entertainer), Criminal Contact (criminal), Military Rank (soldier), Position of Privilege (noble), or Shelter of the Faithful (acolyte). Once made, you cannot change this choice. This is who you are now, and the background feature suggests what people will expect of you. If you have Shelter of the Faithful, it’s because you’ve taken the place of an acolyte, and people of your assumed faith expect you to live up to that role. Variant Feature: Aquatic Adaptation If your character has the malenti background, your DM may allow you to select this background feature instead of Stolen Identity. Your assumed form has no particular reputation or influence. But you were magebred to operate both above and below the water, and possess the ability to breathe underwater. This is granted by gills set along your ribs, which are clearly not normal for your apparent species. If your torso is exposed, this will certainly draw attention. Suggested Characteristics Malenti are deep cover spies. Becoming a malenti means sacrificing the sahuagin world you’ve known your whole life; it requires strong will and devotion. But malenti are a blend of sahuagin spy and the person they appear to be; they still have the memories and the mannerisms of the victim, and this can cause the sahuagin personality to erode or evolve.

You can roll on the following table to determine this hardship or choose one that best fits your character. d6 Hardship 1 Nearly Drowned. You hid underwater to avoid detection by enemies and held your breath for an extremely long time. Just before you would have died, you had a revelation about your existence. 2 Captured.

Some of your past comrades may think you’re dead. 4 Juggernaut. No reasonable explanation can explain how you survived a particular battle. Every arrow and bolt missed you. You slew scores of enemies single-handedly and led your comrades to victory. 5 Stowaway. For days, you hid in the bilge of an enemy ship, surviving on brackish water and foolhardy rats. At the right moment, you crept up to the deck and took over the ship on your own. 6 Leave None Behind. You carried an injured marine for miles to avoid capture and death. Suggested Characteristics Marines are looked up to by other soldiers and respected by their superiors. They are veteran warriors who rarely lose composure on the battlefield. Marines who leave the service tend to work as mercenaries, but their combat experience also makes them excellent adventurers.

Many investigators feel the weight and responsibility of delivering the truth, or at least their view of it, to the rest of the galaxy.

Daidu is a lean, long, sour-faced man, and his wives, brother, sons, daughters, nephews, and grandchildren make up the majority of the ordu’s population. The Menghes family are excellent herders of sheep, and one of Daidu’s wives, Bortelun, is a renowned weaver of blankets, carpets, and other woolen goods. The Menghes family is also ambitious, hoping to secure high-ranking positions thanks to their alliance with the Moto family in Khanbulak or among the White Horde—or, at minimum, good marriages and enough wealth to start their own ordus for Daidu’s children. Daidu’s yurt is a large and impressive affair, its wool walls dyed a pale orange. A white horsehair banner flies from a pole near the tent’s entrance, marking the family as followers of the Lords of Death. A small shrine travels with the ordu, and the shrine includes an urn with a name: Orojin, Daidu’s eldest son. Orojin was killed in a skirmish twelve years ago, and Menghes Daidu holds the Calamac family responsible.

Most are small-scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are described below. The Chill. The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civilization. Silent Rain. Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if interested. The Bloodaxes. Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold Bloodaxes. Feature: Mercenary Life You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including the names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see “Practicing a Profession” under “Downtime Activities” in chapter 8 of the Player’s Handbook).

Some are still driven by the pursuit of material wealth; others turn their backs on gold and greed. d8 Personality Trait 1 I love the rhythm of the picks chipping away at the rock face. 2 Being a miner is tough. Digging through solid rock to find gold isn’t a job for wimps. 3 I left my clanhold because it was time to see the world. 4 The lust for gold drove my father mad. I warn everyone I meet of its danger. 5 I am happiest wandering alone in dark places below the ground. 6 It’s best to stick to the old ways and traditions that our tribal elders taught us. 7 I can tell you stories of things living beneath the earth that will make your hair stand on end. 8 I take pride in my work.

We should all share our wealth with those less fortunate than ourselves. (Good) d6 Bond 1 My canton is my home and hearth. 2 When my father died, my mother gave me his miner’s lamp. I keep it polished and bright, just like he did, in his memory. 3 I am a sworn and loyal member of the Fraternal Order of the Illuminated Brothers. 4 A rival miner cheated me out of my lucky strike and I lost out on a fortune. One day I’ll get my revenge. 5 My sister saved me from a gas explosion. I owe her my life. 6 I’m adventuring to provide for my family. Their mine is exhausted. d6 Flaw 1 Wide open spaces make me uncomfortable. 2 The sight of gold can send me wild with excitement and lust. 3 I ran from a cave-in and abandoned my comrades to their fate. 4 There are tentacled things in the dark that haunt my dreams. Sometimes I wake up screaming. 5 I stole gemstones from the family mine and gambled them away. 6 When I see someone idling, I give them a piece of my mind.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Mirumoto Family - Dragon Clan","description":"The Mirumoto family is renowned for their founder’s unique two-sword style, called “Two Heavens,” but they train their scions to be more than just bushi and duelists. The Mirumoto family also oversees the management and mundane duties of the Dragon Clan, allowing the ascetics of the Togashi Order to pursue their paths on the way to Enlightenment. Living in a harsh, mountainous region with a sparse population, Mirumoto samurai tend to be practical and down-to-earth. They are less inclined to draw distinction between the work of samurai and commoners, and it is not uncommon to see Mirumoto samurai stepping in to help with a barley harvest or mending broken fences in an outlying hamlet after a harsh winter. As the largest family of their clan, the Mirumoto are the samurai whom most think of when they think of the Dragon Clan, and their family often handles jobs that require them to leave Dragon lands.

Monsters great and small lurk in the dark places: in caves, in castles, maybe in your attic right this very moment. While others hunt deer, you hunt monsters, not for food, not for sport, but for survival. Without people like you, the world would soon be overrun by dragons, demons, even the dead don't stay quiet. You have spent years studying these creatures, how they fight, where they nest, and most importantly, how you can kill them. There's money to be made by people willing to take a stand against these monsters, but perhaps you fight for more personal reasons. Are you part of a guild, or clan, or secret society?

Some might view themselves as the only thing standing between civilization and ruin, others might view their work as the will of the gods. All of them will have nightmares. d8 Personality Trait 1 I always tell stories of monsters I have faced, even when no one asked. 2 I'm slow to adopt new ideas or technology. The old ways are always the best. 3 I am never afraid. Or at least, I'll never admit it. 4 While I know how to deal with monsters, people are too complicated for me. 5 I long to save up enough money and retire from this life. 6 I always think I know the best strategy to deal with a monster, even one I've never faced. 7 I have learned to live with what I've seen, but I would not wish this life upon anyone else. 8 Every night before going to sleep, I must pray, splash holy water around, and burn sacred herbs.

You were one such child. Found, taken, left, or otherwise given to your monstrous parents, you were raised as one of their own species. Life with your adopted family could not have been easy for you, but the adversity and hardships you experienced only made you stronger. Perhaps you were “rescued” from your adopted family after only a short time with them, or perhaps only now have you realized the truth of your heritage. Maybe you’ve since learned enough civilized behavior to get by, or perhaps your “monstrous” tendencies are more evident. As you set out to make your way in the world, the time you spent with your adopted parents continues to shape your present and your future. Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Survival Languages: One language of your choice, typically your adopted parents’ language (if any) Equipment: A club, handaxe, or spear, a trinket from your life before you were adopted, a set of traveler’s clothes, a collection of bones, shells, or other natural objects, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp Adopted Prior to becoming an adventurer, you defined your history by the creatures who raised you. Choose a type of creature for your adopted parents or roll a d10 and consult the table below. Work with your GM to determine which specific creature of that type adopted you. If you are of a particular race or species that matches a result on the table, your adopted parent can’t be of the same race or species as you, as this background represents an individual raised by a creature or in a culture vastly different or even alien to their birth parents. d10 Creature Type 1 Humanoid (such as gnoll, goblin, kobold, or merfolk) 2 Aberration (such as aboleth, chuul, cloaker, or otyugh) 3 Beast (such as ape, bear, tyrannosaurus rex, or wolf) 4 Celestial or fiend (such as balor, bearded devil, couatl, deva, or unicorn) 5 Dragon (such as dragon turtle, pseudodragon, red dragon, or wyvern) 6 Elemental (such as efreeti, gargoyle, salamander, or water elemental) 7 Fey (such as dryad, green hag, satyr, or sprite) 8 Giant (such as ettin, fire giant, ogre, or troll) 9 Plant or ooze (such as awakened shrub, gray ooze, shambling mound, or treant) 10 Monstrosity (such as behir, chimera, griffon, mimic, or minotaur) Feature: Abnormal Demeanor Your time with your adopted parents taught you an entire lexicon of habits, behaviors, and intuitions suited to life in the wild among creatures of your parents’ type. When you are in the same type of terrain your adopted parent inhabits, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day. In addition, when you encounter a creature like your adopted parent or parents, the creature is disposed to hear your words instead of leaping directly into battle. Mindless or simple creatures might not respond to your overtures, but more intelligent creatures may be willing to treat instead of fight, if you approach them in an appropriate manner. For example, if your adopted parent was a cloaker, when you encounter a cloaker years later, you understand the appropriate words, body language, and motions for approaching the cloaker respectfully and peacefully. Suggested Characteristics When monstrous adoptees leave their adopted parents for the wider world, they often have a hard time adapting. What is common or usual for many humanoids strikes them as surprising, frightening, or infuriating, depending on the individual. Most make an effort to adjust their habits and imitate those around them, but not all. Some lean into their differences, reveling in shocking those around them. When you choose a creature to be your character’s adopted parent, think about how that might affect your character. Was your character treated kindly? Was your character traded by their birth parents to their adopted parents as part of some mysterious bargain? Did your character seek constant escape or do they miss their adopted parents? d8 Personality Trait 1 I don’t eat my friends (at least not while they are alive). My foes, on the other hand . . . 2 Meeting another’s gaze is a challenge for dominance that I never fail to answer. 3 Monsters I understand; people are confusing. 4 There are two types of creatures in life: prey or not-prey. 5 I often use the growls, sounds, or calls of my adopted parents instead of words. 6 Inconsequential items fascinate me. 7 It’s not my fault, I was raised by [insert parent’s type here]. 8 I may look fine, but I behave like a monster. d6 Ideal 1 Wild. After seeing the wider world, I want to be the monster that strikes fear in the hearts of people. (Evil) 2 Insight. I want to understand the world of my adopted parents. (Neutral) 3 Revenge. I want revenge for my lost childhood. Monsters must die! (Any) 4 Harmony. With my unique perspective and upbringing, I hope to bring understanding between the different creatures of the world. (Good) 5 Freedom. My past away from law-abiding society has shown me the ridiculousness of those laws.(Chaotic) 6 Redemption. I will rise above the cruelty of my adopted parent and embrace the wider world. (Lawful) d6 Bond 1 I want to experience every single aspect of the world. 2 I rely on my companions to teach me how to behave appropriately in their society. 3 I have a “sibling,” a child of my adopted parent that was raised alongside me, and now that sibling has been kidnapped! 4 My monstrous family deserves a place in this world, too. 5 I’m hiding from my monstrous family. They want me back! 6 An old enemy of my adopted parents is on my trail. d6 Flaw 1 What? I like my meat raw. Is that so strange? 2 I like to collect trophies from my defeated foes (ears, teeth, bones, or similar). It’s how I keep score. 3 I usually forget about pesky social conventions like “personal property” or “laws.” 4 I am easily startled by loud noises or bright lights. 5 I have trouble respecting anyone who can’t best me in a fight. 6 Kindness is for the weak.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Tome of Heroes"},{"name":"Moshi Family - Centipede Clan","description":"The Centipede Clan are the foremost followers of Lady Sun, and they view themselves as bulwarks of sacred traditions.

Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Persuasion Languages: Infernal Equipment: varies (see the Bargain feature) Feature: Bargain You have made a contract with one of the demonic children of the Master. They may see and hear through you as though you were a familiar. This observation comes and goes depending on the patron. You are aware of when your actions are being monitored, but others are not. Your patron's observation of your life is magical and can be detected by spells such as detect magic while it’s occurring. The observation only functions on the Material Plane. As a reward for being a witness, you are paid 25 gp per month for each level of experience you’ve gained. You start your adventuring career with either: A sustained comfortable lifestyle, a furnished home, two sets of noble's clothes, and 50 gp stored in a chest, or A riding horse with saddle, an explorer's pack, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 25 gp.

I perform important work for those above me. This service is its own reward. (Lawful) 4 Wealth. Money moves mountains. (any) 5 Bridge. I have sacrificed my privacy so that dark powers might be transformed by seeing beauty and love. (Good) 6 Knowledge. Knowledge is the only true resource; I must give it to receive it. (any) d6 Bond 1 I will do my time, then reap my reward. 2 This cursed bargain must be revoked by any means necessary. 3 I will see the world, meet with queens, slay my enemies, and be judged worthy of a place on the mountain. 4 I must slay the creature I made this bargain with. 5 Demon Mountain will fall, and my bargain is a necessary price to get close to its rulers. 6 I will deceive another creature into replacing me in this bargain. d6 Flaw 1 When my patron watches through me, I grow bitter and cruel. 2 I cannot rest properly for a day after being an active witness. 3 Visions of the Eleven Hells appear before me at inopportune times. 4 If I let someone too close, they will discover my secret. 5 I am terrible with money. 6 I seek greater and greater danger to impress my patron.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Muse","description":"A muse is someone who inspires great works of art, epic poems, or daring acts of bravery. They are loved and celebrated wherever they go, and have legions of adoring fans, artists, and suitors. Many muses are artists in their own right, and travel the world to inspire and be inspired by others. Often beautiful, always brilliant, muses might turn to a life of adventure to escape the confines of city life, experience daring adventure, or just to get some battle scars. A muse might be considered blessed by the gods, or cursed with a great and terrible beauty that marks you as different to everyone around you. Do you enjoy your position of influence? Or do you find it isolating, and long for a normal life?

You can inspire artisans, bards, and anyone else you meet to create art, or create art yourself without traditional tools or materials. You know artists or patrons who can provide your party with shelter and aid you with information on local people of interest, rumors, and gossip. Suggested Characteristics Muses are often embroiled in high society, and as such might utilize charm in one circle, guile in another, and effortless grace whoever they're with. They can inspire people to be their best selves, or ruin lives with a glance. A muse can be an artist, politician, intermediary, or spy, and may be all of these and more. You might be tired of being fawned over, and long to break away from what is expected of you. But whatever you do and wherever you do it, you do it with style. d8 Personality Trait 1 I'm a great lover and supporter of the arts. 2 I pretend to be against violence, but secretly I love a good fight. 3 I'm generous with my time, energy, and money. 4 I'm a scholar, philosopher, and historian, and strive to learn all I can. 5 I'm always working on a new project, yet I never seem to finish anything. 6 I try to inspire everyone around me to be the best they can be. 7 While I may entertain dozens of people in a day, I long for solitude. 8 I flirt with everyone I meet. d6 Ideal 1 Duty.

I must honor the terms of that bargain. 3 Despite all my admirers, there's only one person for me. 4 I consider myself blessed by the gods, and give thanks to them each day. 5 I'm on a quest to create the world's most epic poem. 6 Everyone's an artist, and all artists are my friends. d6 Flaw 1 I believe I'm the most attractive, interesting, and wonderful person in the world.

There's always someone I can charm for a discount. 4 Secretly, I know nothing about art. As long as I nod and smile, I don't need to. 5 I love it when people fight over me, and actively encourage it. 6 I'm painfully insecure, and need to be constantly validated by others.

You see them, you see them all. Baba Yaga, as changing as the Sands of Sorrows, as steady as the placement of the stars. Grandmother she is called, though she has only daughters. The legends of this powerful witch are known far beyond the Rothenian Plain. You carry the stories of her in your heart, memorized and trotted out too often in conversation. You have been called odd, ill-fated, and worse, but you take comfort in your surety that she is watching you. You have spent time in study of her. What was it that drew you to her? Did you have a vision while riding to Bjornshafen? Did you hear a raspy voice inside Kariv singing that only you could hear? The fog condensed on the window from the breath of tavern-goers in Vidim; did it show you the shape of your future? Magic has always drawn you. The ley lines call to you, ask for you. You see the cairns built upon the Rothenian Plain, where the ley lines cross and knot. You know it is perilous to invoke her and deadly to seek her company, but there, just now, you saw the way the sparrow took flight. Its flapping was portentous. She watches, she knows, she is here.

Feature: Grandmother's Touch Your obsession with Grandmother Yaga has, for better or worse, drawn her attention to you. You may spend a day locating and interpreting the signs of the great witch (counts as downtime). After doing so, you may choose one of the following: Locate Veela: The location of the nearest Veela appears to you in a vision. Baleful Eye: One of your eyes becomes yellow and milky for a day. The eye allows you to see into the souls of nearby creatures and detect any lies they tell. Good-hearted folk who see the clouded eye treat you with suspicion or outright hostility. Sustained by Dust: Your food and water requirement for the next day are met by eating one pound of any organic matter.

Your homeland labors under a generations-old curse laid by Baba Yaga. Today, your people exist because of a pact struck with a great devil from the Eleven Hells. The pine forests of your home survive because of blood sacrifice paid to the forces of Hell, so the devils hold Baba Yaga’s wrath at bay.

While the family appears to be a playful association of acrobats, actors, and noted playwrights, in truth they are a successful clan of mercenary shinobi, selling their skills as thieves to the other clans. Unlike most shinobi, the Cat Clan teaches its members to disdain bloodshed, and never to kill when deception, misdirection, or a clever con suffice. It is said that if something is wrongfully stolen, members of the Cat Clan often take jobs to return it for free—but if the original owner does not appreciate the item enough after its return, the capricious shinobi may abscond with it themself. However, if you need something stolen, there is no clan in which you can find a better thief than the Cat Clan.

When Is a Noble Not a Noble? Just as you can be a noble without the noble background, you can also take the noble background or its Position of Privilege feature even if your character isn't part of the nobility. This is an especially good option for wealthy or influential members of dragonmarked houses. As a dragonmarked “noble,” you're either close to house leadership or part of an especially wealthy or powerful branch of the family—and people know it. You’re treated as an equal by nobles, you can request an audience with local authorities, and common folk are generally impressed by you. Gaining Privilege … Just as adventurers can become soldiers or criminals during a campaign, it’s possible for them to be raised to the nobility. The traditions associated with this are described in later sections, but what’s the practical impact of this elevation? Does a new noble gain the benefits of Position of Privilege? What are their duties and responsibilities? An adventurer could gain a noble title as a reward for service, or in some nations, a soldier could win their title through battle. This might be a substantive title—one that grants land and subjects, which can be passed down to heirs—or simply a courtesy that doesn’t carry lands or duties. Being granted a knighthood may not confer the benefits of Position of Privilege, but it also probably won’t prevent you from further adventuring. On the other hand, becoming a Lhazaar prince might grant that privilege, but it also complicates your adventuring life significantly! You’ll either need to manage your principality or employ people to do it for you (the Valenar method) and hope they do a good job. When you grant player characters substantive titles as part of a campaign you’re DMing, you may wish to make the management and defense of their domain an integral part of the campaign moving forward. On the other hand, if Boranel grants someone the title of Shield of the East, it’s a symbolic courtesy that carries significant weight with Brelish nobles (as it reflects the favor of the king), but it bestows no actual responsibilities and doesn’t have the impact of Position of Privilege in other nations. The “Variant Noble: Newly Risen” sidebar presents a background variant you might select if your character’s meteoric rise draws attention from people who hope to benefit from your newfound influence. Alternatively, a DM might consider granting the Rising Star feature to a character who rises to the nobility during a campaign. Variant Noble: Newly Risen Your family has risen to the aristocracy very recently. Service to the crown, a heroic deed, or an extraordinarily generous donation may have contributed to your success. Though older and more entrenched noble families meet their obligations toward you, they may still look on you with disdain. Meanwhile, there is no shortage of other folks looking to ride your coattails to a new and better life. Feature: Rising Star Your name is known among monied individuals in your home country. You generally enjoy the utmost respect of non-aristocratic upper and middle classes. You can expect reasonable accommodations and inside information from such people in return for a simple non-monetary favor, such as passing their name or details of their business along to another noble.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Keith Baker Presents","book":"Chronicles of Eberron"},{"name":"Noble","description":"You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them. Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you. Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the comm⁠on people regard them? What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career?

You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The comm⁠on folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Suggested Characteristics Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble. d8 Personality Trait 1 My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world. 2 The com⁠mon folk love me for my kindness and generosity. 3 No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses. 4 I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions. 5 I don’t like to get my hands dirty, and I won’t be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations. 6 Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk.

Variant Feature: Retainers If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege. You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Player's Handbook"},{"name":"Noble","description":"Ability Scores Strength, Intelligence, Charisma Feat Skilled Skill Proficiencies History and Persuasion Tool Proficiency Choose one kind of Gaming Set Equipment Choose A or B: (A) Gaming Set (same as above), Fine Clothes, Perfume, 29 GP; or (B) 50 GP You were raised in a castle, surrounded by wealth, power, and privilege.

Whether you are a larger-than-life performer hailing from one of the skaldic schools, a contemplative scholar attempting to puzzle out the mysteries of the north, or a doughty warrior hoping to stave off the bleakness of the north, you have successfully navigated alleys and stages as treacherous as any ice-slicked ruin. You adventure for the thrill of adding new songs to your repertoire, adding new lore to your catalog, and proving false the claims of those so-called true northerners. Skill Proficiencies: Perception plus one of your choice from among History or Performance Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A book collecting all the songs, poems, or stories you know, a pair of snowshoes, one musical instrument of your choice, a heavy fur-lined cloak, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Skaldic Specialty Every minstrel excels at certain types of performance. Choose one specialty or roll a d8 and consult the table below to determine your preferred type of performance. d8 Specialty 1 Recitation of epic poetry 2 Singing 3 Tale-telling 4 Flyting (insult flinging) 5 Yodeling 6 Axe throwing 7 Playing an instrument 8 Fire eating or sword swallowing Feature: Northern Historian Your education and experience have taught you how to determine the provenance of ruins, monuments, and other structures within the north. When you spend at least 1 hour examining a structure or non-natural feature of the terrain, you can determine if it was built by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, giants, trolls, or fey. You can also determine the approximate age (within 500 years) of the construction based on its features and embellishments. Suggested Characteristics Northern minstrels tend to either be loud and larger than life or pensive and watchful with very few falling between these extremes. Many exude both qualities at different times, and they have learned how and when to turn their skald persona on and off. Like other northerners, northern minstrels place a lot of stock in appearing brave and tough, which can lead them unwittingly into conflict. d8 Personality Trait 1 I will accept any dare and expect accolades when I complete it. 2 Revelry and boisterousness are for foolish children. I prefer to quietly wait and watch. 3 I am more than a match for any northern reaver. If they believe that is not so, let them show me what stuff they are made of. 4 I yearn for the raiding season and all the tales of blood and butchery I can use to draw the crowds. 5 Ragnarok is nigh. I will bear witness to the end of all things and leave a record should there be any who survive it. 6 There is nothing better in life than hot mutton, honeyed mead, and a crowd in thrall to my words. 7 The gods weave our fates. There is nothing to do but accept this and live as we will. 8 All life is artifice. I lie better than most and am not ashamed to reap the rewards of my deceptions. d6 Ideal [This table was misformatted] 1 Valor. Stories and songs should inspire others—and me—to perform great deeds that benefit us all. (Good) 2 Greed. There is little point in taking action if it leads to living in squalor. I will take what I want and dare any who disagree to oppose me. (Evil) 3 Perfection. I will not let the threat of failure deter me. Every deed I attempt, even those I do not succeed at, serve to improve me and prepare me for future endeavors. (Lawful) 4 Anarchy. If Ragnarok is coming to end all that is, I must do what I want and damn the consequences. (Chaotic) 5 Knowledge. The north is full of ruins and ancient monuments. If I can glean their meaning, I may understand fate as well as the gods. (Any) 6 Pleasure. I will eat the richest food, sleep in the softest bed, enjoy the finest company, and allow no one to stand in the way of my delight and contentment. (Any) d6 Bond 1 I have the support of my peers from the skaldic school I attended, and they have mine. 2 I will find and answer the Unanswerable Riddle and gain infamy. 3 I will craft an epic of such renown it will be recited the world over. 4 All my companions were slain in an ambush laid by cowardly trolls. At least I snatched up my tagelharpa before I escaped the carnage. 5 The cold waves call to me even across great distances. I must never stray too far from the ocean’s embrace. 6 It is inevitable that people fail me. Mead, on the other hand, never fails to slake my thirst. d6 Flaw 1 Only a coward retreats. The valiant press forward to victory or death. 2 All the tales I tell of my experiences are lies. 3 Critics and hecklers will suffer my wrath once the performance is over. 4 Companions and friends cease to be valuable if their accomplishments outshine my own. 5 I once burned down a tavern where I was poorly received.

Your life is a series of challenges to be overcome, spoils to be taken, and honor to be earned. You have sailed the icy northern seas in the dead of winter and the black of night, and you have put your enemies to the blade and the flame. Your name is fear on the lips of your foes and glory in the songs of your comrades. Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Vehicles (water) Languages: Giant Equipment: A plundered memento from a past raid, a coil of hemp rope, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 5 gp. Feature: Reaver’s Journey Many sailors fear to sail far from charted water and familiar shores. Some balk at steering into the teeth of a gale in the dead of night. They are not you. As long as you aren’t traveling at a fast pace, you can’t lose your way under normal conditions. Inclement weather, lack of tools, or magic might impose penalties or steer you awry at the GMs discretion. Additionally, if you don’t undertake any other activity while traveling on a rowed vessel, you can drive the rowers to push beyond their ordinary limits. The rowers can crew the ship for 1 additional hour before risking exhaustion. Suggested Characteristics Northlands reavers live by a strict code of behavior and honor that seems paradoxical to outsiders. Though you are brutal in battle, you are also fearless, honorable, and hospitable. This even applies to your enemies outside of battle, so long as they return the courtesy. Bloodthirsty reavers are common, though, and those who reject honor and become outlaws are among the most feared brigands in all of Midgard. d8 Personality Trait 1 I drink. I sing. I fight. I live. 2 I long for the next test against a worthy opponent. 3 I come alive on the sea and pine for the salt air when I must leave it behind. 4 I never lay my most trusted weapon aside. 5 I love to tell stories of my great deeds.

I know it holds the key to my destiny. 5 My mother’s ship was lost at sea, but she’s still out there. I’ll find her. 6 My clan’s home is sacred ground. I’ll do anything to protect it. d6 Flaw 1 I lose myself in the heat and blood of battle. Orders and plans become a distant blur. 2 Alliances are all well and good, but gold is gold. 3 A slight demands blood. No other payment will do. 4 I ran from battle once.

The greatest keeper of this knowledge is the theurge. As a theurge, you study the flow of the River Nuria that gives life to the desert, both physically as a source of fresh water, and magically as one of the largest ley lines in the world. You are the keeper of life and preserver of the dead for the next world. Most theurges are either clerics or wizards, but all have a working knowledge of both divine and arcane magic. Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Religion Tool Proficiencies: Calligrapher's tools Languages: One of your choice between Ancient Nurian and Celestial Equipment: A roll of linen strips, sacred texts and diagrams, a set of common clothes, a small packet of spices, and a pouch containing 5 gp. Feature: Preservation The first theurges venerated Anu-Akma and learned the secrets of mummification. By applying those teachings, you can prepare a body for the final journey or even for the return to life. With 8 hours of work and access to proper materials such as linen and spices (25 gp cost), you can preserve a dead creature's body. This preservation slows decay, allowing a body to remain intact for potentially thousands of years if undisturbed. A preserved body counts as 1 day dead for every month that passes for purposes of spells or other magical effects. Suggested Characteristics Theurges are somber, solemn individuals. Many of them serve a god such as Aten or Anu-Akma. All are studious individuals who hold knowledge of the past in high regard. Theurges range from compassionate keepers of the dead, to dour souls who seek the darkness of preservation through undeath. d8 Personality Trait 1 Scriptures of the gods give us insight into any situation, and I quote them often. 2 I show great respect for any place of burial. 3 I am quiet and contemplative. Others tell me I am unnerving, but I don't see it. 4 I smell of spices and oils. 5 My clothing always bears some seal of the gods of the dead. 6 Desecration of the dead drives me to righteous rage. 7 I always carry a supply of fresh, potable water. 8 I enjoy learning about other people's lives. d6 Ideal 1 Comfort.

I avoid it at all costs. 3 I will trade anything or anyone to secure eternal life. 4 I take a fatalistic view of life and death, often dismissing the deaths of those who aren't close to me. 5 I resent the gods for their greed, and I want to undermine their power. 6 My understanding of the world is unshakable.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Occultist","description":"At your core, you are a believer in things others dismiss.

Perhaps you’ve always yearned toward the occult, or it could be that you encountered something or someone who opened your eyes to the possibilities. You may belong to some esoteric organization determined to uncover the mystery, a cult bent on using the secrets for a dark purpose, or you may be searching for answers on your own.

When you’re trying to find something that pertains to eldritch secrets or dark knowledge, you have a good idea of where to start looking. Usually, this information comes from information brokers, disgraced scholars, chaotic mages, dangerous cults, or insane priests. Your GM might rule that the knowledge you seek isn’t found with just one contact, but this feature provides a starting point. Suggested Characteristics Occultists can’t resist the lure of an ancient ruin, forgotten dungeon, or the lair of some mysterious cult. They eagerly follow odd rumors, folktales, and obscure clues found in dusty tomes. Some adventure with the hope of turning their discoveries into fame and fortune, while others consider the answers they uncover to be the true reward. Whatever their motivations, occultists combine elements of archaeologist, scholar, and fanatic. d8 Personality Trait 1 I always ask questions, especially if I think I can learn something new. 2 I believe every superstition I hear and follow their rules fanatically. 3 The things I know give me nightmares, and not only when I sleep. 4 Nothing makes me happier than explaining some obscure lore to my friends. 5 I startle easily. 6 I perform a host of rituals throughout the day that I believe protect me from occult threats. 7 I never know when to give up. 8 The more someone refuses to believe me, the more I am determined to convince them. d6 Ideal 1 Domination.

There are mentions of non-vor’tai members of this ‘Silver Staff’ – how did they get there? Planar travel is no small feat. Perhaps the vor visit our realm for recruitment purposes? Sooner or later, however, adventure found you. Whether by your own choice or by another’s, you no longer call the Halls home. Think about why your character left – was it their decision or one made for them? Under what circumstances might they be able to return? Do they want to?

Your twin was stillborn, but you were the picture of health and, as such, considered blessed. 3 The river near your village ran inexplicably red the day you were born, and it killed most of the fish. The subsequent year was a hungry one. Folk say you’re bad luck. 4 You are the child of a charismatic religious leader and his beautiful wife, whose womb, rumor had it until then, was barren. They said you were a gift from their god, a chosen savior who could do no wrong. The faithful believe it. 5 You were born with the umbilical cord wrapped around your neck like a hangman’s noose. Your father wanted to kill you then and there, but your mother and aunt didn’t let him. 6 You come from an old and proud lineage whose seventh children have a habit of dying early. All of them, until you came along. The family wizard assures them this marks you as someone chosen to change the world. 7 You were born with an axe-shaped birthmark on the palm of your left hand, just like a famous conqueror from the past supposedly did. Then you grew up left-handed. The first assassin came for you when you were four years old. 8 That crazy uncle always said his nephew would be “the emissary from the darkness between the stars!”. When you opened your eyes—one silver-colored, the other pitchblack— people started worrying about what it meant. Feature: Wretched Kin You know outcasts and where they gather. Beggars, vagrants, fugitives, and those otherwise disinherited by this world. You’ve been there, and you know how to work with them. If there’s a gathering place for such people in the area, you can find it easily. There, you can count on their solidarity. If you need to lay low, they take you in, no questions asked— but won’t risk their lives for you if threatened. If you need information about goings on in the streets or people passing by, one of them tells you something useful promptly. They will even perform small, relatively safe services, like delivering messages or distracting someone, for a small fee (at least 5 sp)— as much as they feel for you, they need money to eat. You can, of course, sour the relationship if you bring them harm. Suggested Characteristics Omen-Born tend to carry a lot of trauma and misconceptions with them, regardless of their supposed fates and innate tendencies. The ones who end up on the adventurous path soon have to grapple with their baggage. The world out there is much more complex than their formative years led them to believe, for good or ill. D6 Personality Trait 1 I push away those who try to get close to me 2 I avoid talking about your past at all costs 3 I’m reckless, convinced that the world will make way 4 The weight of destiny crushes me. Drinking helps 5 I am slow to trust, quick to strike first 6 I am easily swayed by praise D6 Ideal 1 Redemption. No sin too great. Redemption is attainable. (Good) 2 Rejection. Gods and spirits have no place in mortal affairs. (Any) 3 Freedom. The freedom to walk one’s own path is the greatest good. (Chaotic) 4 Spite. I live to prove those people wrong. (Any) 5 Revenge. I must drown the world in the blood of my tormentors. (Evil) 6 Conduit. My fate is a force of nature. It is predetermined, and I’m merely its vessel (Lawful) D6 Bond 1 I will lift my people to glory no matter what. 2 I will step out of the shadow and be a great force for good! 3 My happiness is secondary to fulfilling the prophecy and beginning a new age. 4 They treated me like a person and showed me a life unburdened by omens. I owe them everything. 5 I will make this world a better place for those upon whom fate hasn’t smiled as it did to me. 6 I will destroy those who would wield me as a pen to write history. D6 Flaw 1 My sense of self-importance makes me insufferable. 2 I am never to blame for anything that goes wrong. 3 I always overestimate my capabilities and underestimate others. 4 I know I’m doomed anyway, so why try to do better? 5 I don’t take no for an answer. To deny me is to know pain. 6 I play others like pieces on a board. Most people are just resources for me.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Lone Colossus Games","book":"Injuries and Vile Deeds"},{"name":"Oracle","description":"The path of fate is ever-flowing. Oracles are rare individuals who have been gifted with the ability to see further beyond the mortal realm and into the mechanisms of the cosmos itself to some degree. Some are granted this power by gods with domains within the intricacies of fate and prophecy. To the casual observer most things in life are nothing more than coincidences, but to an Oracle, the strings of Fate occasionally become as clear as the light of the sun. Where seemingly unlinked events lead to a particular result, these lines in the tapestry of fate become a piece of art that Oracles are able to catch glimpse at throughout their mortal life. You may have served a kingdom or a city as an advisor, tried to use this gift for your own benefit or even kept it completely to yourself so as to not stand out. However, fate never stays still and your own is somewhere out there, where you haven't been able to see just yet. You must look for it and figure out what to do with it. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools and one gaming set of your choice (cards, dice, or some other divination tool) Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A gaming set of your choice, a token of appreciation from someone you helped through divination, a set of Common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp Feature: Gazing into the Future You are able to use your gift in a minor way. Through a small ritual that lasts 1 hour, in which you converse with the target of your divination and use your preferred method of reading the flow of fate, you are able to discern minor details about the target's future. Once this ritual is finished you can offer insight and rather vague details that might help or inconvenience the target. After using this ritual you can expect your target to be more relaxed, friendly and perhaps willing to listen to you. At least, as long as they view your reading of their future favorably. Finally, you can receive aid and minor favors from people you have interacted with in this way before, such as information, shelter, food or medical attention. Assume that you may have at least one friendly contact in every settlement or city you've spent any significant amount of time in. Suggested Characteristics Oracles are all wildly different from each other in how they view their ability to read into the strings of fate. Some of them may be humbled and use their gift to aid others, while others may feel like cursed victims who resent the higher powers who gave them such an ability. The one thing every oracle can say is that they understand that there is a design, where others would simply see happenstance and coincidence. d8 Personality Trait 1 Unexpected events rarely faze me and sometimes feel oddly familiar. 2 I compulsively fiddle with a card, coin, or other tool used for my divination skills. 3 I'm self conscious about my visions of the future and nervous about sharing them. 4 If someone offends me I will tell them of their doomed fate. It may not be real, but the panic in their faces most definitely is. 5 The glimpses of the future I see frighten me and I try to avoid them at all costs. 6 While I enjoy sharing my insights, I never give them away for free. 7 I often change details about my visions. It's not as if they need to know, right? 8 My optimism never wavers. I’ve seen that things will turn out well in the end, one way or another. d6 Ideal 1 Aspiration. I’ve seen a hint of greatness in my own future, and I will work hard to achieve it. (Any) 2 Truth. I am a servant of the truth, and I will share it for good or ill. (Lawful) 3 Freedom. Knowing what may or may not come in the future, means that there's a chance to do something about it. (Chaotic) 4 Savior. I want to use my gift to prevent evil and misfortune from reaching kind and innocent people. (Good) 5 Guidance. One can never truly escape Fate, I can only guide people to theirs. (Neutral) 6 Control. My gifts give me the perfect leverage to move others to my tune. (Evil) d6 Bond 1 My grandmother passed a token to me when she explained our gift of The Sight. It’s my most prized possession. 2 I’m compulsively driven to read the fortune of powerful people. 3 My vision saved a town from a monster invasion. 4 I know secrets that could have devastating consequences if not revealed to the right people. 5 I've read the fortune of good people. Shortly after, they perished. This is a curse. 6 I told one fortune whose meaning I still can’t understand, but I know it has great importance. d6 Flaw 1 I saw a truth once that I refused to speak, and Tragedy was the result. It haunts me to this day. 2 My visions make me arrogant in matters I have foreseen. It's not as if the visions can be wrong. 3 I loathe charlatans and tricksters who take advantage of those who seek their fortunes, and I do what I can to discredit them. 4 I am always jealous of positive readings I make of people, since I cannot see my own future clearly. 5 I can't accept someone criticizing my visions. I know what I saw! 6 I can’t resist embellishing a fortune to try to earn a few more coins or a better impression.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"David Serrano","book":"Warriors of the New World"},{"name":"Order of the Gauntlet","description":"You are a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, an organization devoted to crushing evil when it rears its ugly head.

All of the guild’s endeavors channel wealth from Ravnican society into the ranks of the Orzhov —and concentrates the spoils at the top of the hierarchy. As a functionary in that system, your best hope is to claim as much as possible of the money that passes through your hands on its way up, so that you can work your way into a more prominent position. Regardless of your past and the wealth of your family, your initial status with the guild is near the bottom, until you have proven your value. Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Religion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: An Orzhov insignia, a foot-long chain made of ten gold coins, vestments, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 1 pp (an Orzhov-minted 10-zino coin) Feature: Leverage You can exert leverage over one or more individuals below you in the guild’s hierarchy and demand their help as needs warrant. For example, you can have a message carried across a neighborhood, procure a short carriage ride without paying, or have others clean up a bloody mess you left in an alley. The DM decides if your demands are reasonable and if there are subordinates available to fulfill them. As your status in the guild improves, you gain influence over more people, including ones in greater positions of power.

Thanks to his formidable powers of persuasion and manipulation, he was an expert at defusing conflicts that threatened to destroy his tribe. His wit and cunning soon proved of enormous value to the divine sibling Hantei as he sought to unite the disparate people of the nascent Empire of Rokugan. Today, the Otomo family still serves in the role of keeping Rokugan united, but sometimes this can also mean pitting the Great Clans against each other. In order to prevent the clans from privately uniting and gaining undue influence—or even seizing control of the Throne altogether—the Otomo use diplomacy to keep the various Great Clans at odds over contested territory, prestige, and other minor issues that never escalate to full civil war but allow the Imperial Court to play mediator, thus retaining its position of control.

You quickly mastered the skills required to identify and process rare and complex botanical and alchemical samples and the proper extractions and infusions of essential oils, pollens, and other fragrant chemical compounds—natural or otherwise. Not all (dramatic) changes to one’s lifestyle, calling, or ambitions are a result of social or financial decline. Some are simply decided upon.

When you see someone blatantly disregarding the rules, you can’t help but intervene.

You may also choose to throw your privilege around for a few benefits such as upgrades to lodgings, moving to the front of the line or getting a few trade discounts from merchants looking to get into your good graces. Suggested Characteristics Patricians are born into a lifestyle that most other people will never experience or understand in their lifetime. A position of power and status comes with wealth and privilege, but also comes with a wealth of responsibility.

A creature that finishes a long rest while in your care has advantage on the next saving throw it makes against a disease it is suffering. Suggested Characteristics Plague doctors are both brave and curious. Though their training strays toward the esoteric, plague doctors are intelligent and motivated learners. Some may be cold and analytical scholars of pestilence, while others are inspired to heal the afflicted. In their darkest moments, a plague doctor is a detached spectator to suffering, struggling to feel for others through the thick skin their profession has provided. d8 Personality Trait 1 I am brave and able to function well under stressful conditions. 2 I am curious about the world, its inhabitants, and its illnesses. 3 I am detached emotionally from situations that require empathy. 4 I care for the well-being of others and encourage healthy living. 5 I am obsessive about my interests.

Your character might belong to one of these groups or another ideological faction, perhaps one of your own creation. The primary factions of Sigil, which are further detailed in chapter 2, adhere to the following philosophies: Athar. Deities are frauds and merely channel the might of a true, higher power. Bleak Cabal. There is no greater truth to the multiverse. Each being must discover their own meaning. Doomguard. Nothing lasts forever. The purpose of everything is to crumble and decay. Fated. Everyone makes their own fate and is entitled to whatever they can take and hold. Fraternity of Order. All of existence is governed by laws, and power comes from understanding and exploiting them. Hands of Havoc. Those who try to impose a single order on the multiverse are doomed to fail. Harmonium. The multiverse will be perfect only when everything is acting in harmony, whether it wants to or not. Heralds of Dust. Everyone is already dead; the entirety of the multiverse is an afterlife. Undeath holds the key to the next stage of existence. Mercykillers. Cold, relentless justice is absolute, and no one is above it. Mind’s Eye. The multiverse exists to be explored. It shapes us, and we shape it in turn. Society of Sensation. Sensation is the proof of existence. By experiencing everything, we can understand the multiverse in all its complexity. Transcendent Order. Thought clouds action. To fall in step with the multiverse, one must act on instinct alone. Creating Your Own Faction In Sigil, ideologies wax and wane over time, gaining popularity and drawing like-minded philosophers from one faction to another—the only constant in the City of Doors is the Lady of Pain herself.

In addition, members of your organization provide you free, modest lodging and food at any of their holdings or the homes of other faction members. Building a Planar Philosopher Character Some groups of planar philosophers might prefer certain types of characters, but by and large any character who upholds and furthers the beliefs of such a group is welcome within its ranks. Suggested Characteristics. Adventurers who dedicate themselves to a particular philosophy regarding the multiverse are welcomed among factions that embrace those beliefs. The Planar Philosopher Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character. Planar Philosopher Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I don’t venerate any gods.

Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument or artisan’s tools Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A bottle of black ink, an ink pen, a set of artisan’s tools or a musical instrument (one of your choice), a school uniform, and a pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Prismari Initiate You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Prismari within it. In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Prismari Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Prismari Spells Spell Level Spells 1st Chromatic Orb , Thunderwave 2nd Flaming Sphere , Kinetic Jaunt 3rd Haste , Water Walk 4th Freedom of Movement , Wall of Fire 5th Cone of Cold , Conjure Elemental Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. You might wield your Prismari spells with dynamic, gestural movement—as much dance as somatic component. Even a blast of fire in your hands is a sculpted work of art; elemental forces make grand designs as you hurl spells. These forces might linger on your body or in your clothes as decorative elements after your spells are dissipated, as sparks dance in your hair and your touch leaves tracings of frost on whatever you touch. Building a Prismari Character Any class or subclass that wields elemental forces of cold, fire, lightning, and wind can be a good fit in Prismari. Druids and sorcerers are common in Prismari, and wizards who study the Schools of Evocation or Transmutation are also well represented. Clerics aren’t very common in this school, but some with the Tempest domain end up here. Beyond the ranks of traditional spellcasters, Lorehold students also include monks who follow the Way of the Four Elements. Some acrobatic rogues and fighters (including those who emulate the archetype of the Eldritch Knight) also delight in the athleticism of Prismari performance. Suggested Characteristics. Though the curriculum of Prismari College attracts many outgoing and driven artists, the school has no shortage of shy scholars and lackadaisical blowhards among its ranks. The Prismari Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character. Prismari Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I’m the life of the party, and I expect everyone’s attention when I walk into a room. 2 Two weeks ago, I was enthralled with my latest project. Now, I think it’s garbage and deserves to be destroyed. 3 I believe everyone has the ability to express their truest selves through art, and I’m happy to quietly push them in the right direction. 4 Everyone is a critic, and I work to win them all over. 5 I’m beset with such an overwhelming sense of ennui regarding my art. Nothing quite captures my attention anymore. 6 Instead of confronting my negative emotions, I channel them into explosive artistic displays. Prismari Trinkets.

You gain advantage whenever competing in an amateur sport or competition that calls upon your athleticism. Suggested Characteristics As athletes are driven to excel, they try to bring their level of dedication to whatever new path they choose. Sometimes, though, such a major change can drag them down. They can sometimes drift from one job or gig to another without an anchor. Regardless, an athlete understands the importance of details, practice, and keeping a daily regime. d8 Personality Trait 1 I used to be rising star, which I remind people about when I get depressed. 2 I try to forget my past and look to building a new future and new competitions to win. 3 I keep trying over and over until I succeed. 4 I’m living for me now, since my childhood was wasted winning trophies that helped no one. 5 I still like to workout, but there are bills to pay and have to find work. 6 I am still the biggest fan of my sport and see it as metaphor for life. 7 I can’t stand sports anymore and avoid talking about it. 8 I’m looking for the next superstar. Now is the time to find a pupil. d6 Ideal 1 Pragmatic . Talent helps, but you can never underestimate luck. (Neutral) 2 Helping hand . I know that teamwork is key. (Good) 3 Tradition . Every game has rules for a reason. (Lawful) 4 Cheating . Second place is first loser. (Evil) 5 Freedom . Rules are for chumps but so is always winning. Just have fun. (Chaotic) 6 Aspirational . The first one to act always has the first edge. (Any) d6 Bond 1 I used to fight only for myself. Now, I'll always fight for my teammates. 2 I’m hunting for a new technique to put me back in the game. 3 One of my favorite coaches turned out to be someone I never expected. 4 Something strange happened to one of my biggest fans.

My life is a competition. 4 I avoid some challenges because sometimes you’ve lost before you even play. 5 Bad blood with referees has taught me to never trust the authorities.

You are one such point. There is a greater power at work in the world, and you can see pieces of its design. Unlike the faint glimpses of a fortuneteller or the twisted lies of a charlatan, your words stir something in those who hear your message. From the doomsday ravings of a filthy derelict on the street corner to the polished words of an urbane and refined cult mistress, a prophet is the servant of a higher power, setting the truth of that power into motion. Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, Religion Languages: One of your choice from the following list appropriate to the power that grants your revelations: Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Draconic, Elemental (one dialect), Infernal, or Sylvan Tool Proficiency: One of your choice between calligrapher’s supplies or painter’s supplies Equipment: A holy symbol or idol representing the higher power that grants your revelations, a set of common clothes, a collection of your recorded thoughts and philosophy, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp Feature: Words from on High You have seen the truth, and your word brings that truth into the world. More important, that truth stirs others to action. People who hear and accept your words are moved to action. Such individuals will lend aid and offer their services toward your cause, whether that involves building a new temple, clearing storm damage, or feeding the hungry. They won’t take undue risk, however. Temples and other religious organizations commonly accept prophets of their faith, but noble houses, merchants, trade guilds, and any other organization might share their resources. Additionally, you can secure audiences with powerful individuals or invitations to events that normally exist above your station. From those who fear or oppose your vision you can expect social hostility, though some might fear to act directly against you. Work with the GM to determine the source and subject of your revelations, and what sorts of people they appeal to or offend. Suggested Characteristics Prophets all have one trait in common—conviction. Whether they gleefully spread the good word of a benevolent deity or dire tidings of a coming darkness, the prophet knows in her bones that what she sees, and says, is true. Some may fear this internal certainty. They might attempt to hide their light beneath a bushel and deny the calling. It may take years for a prophet to accept herself, but in the end she can’t deny the truth. d8 Personality Trait 1 I am usually soft-spoken, but I become invigorated when spreading my word. 2 My followers are like my family. 3 I enjoy debating the finer points of my revelations, especially with nonbelievers. 4 Nonbelievers sadden me when they deny my words. 5 I see the truth of my words at work in everyday things. 6 I am uncomfortable outside the confines of a place devoted to my faith. 7 My temper is short when my visions are challenged. 8 Those who refuse to believe in higher powers that govern the world confuse me. d6 Ideal 1 Tenacity. The truth must ring throughout the world. (Any) 2 Revolution. The word brings change that can’t be denied. (Chaotic) 3 Dominion. Mine is the voice that speaks truth, and mine is the word all shall heed. (Evil) 4 Stability. My teachings offer the promise of a better life, and I seek to build that life for those who share my belief. (Lawful) 5 Hope. My revelations bring light to the dark corners of the world. (Good) 6 Fortitude. The message I bear upsets me, but I trust in my higher power. (Neutral) d6 Bond 1 I must protect the scrap of ancient writing that first revealed the truth to me at all costs. 2 The person who stood by my side when the truth first came upon me is the person I hold most dear in this world. 3 I will have revenge on the rival who turned my church against my revelation. 4 I was a sinner before my revelation, and I work tirelessly to make up for my dark past. 5 I know that a rival faith is based on lies, and I seek to enlighten its believers through my revelation. 6 An entire order within my faith once preached the truth of my revelation, but I am the last of them. d6 Flaw 1 In the depths of my soul I am wracked with doubt. If I can’t reconcile my beliefs, my following will suffer. 2 My devotion to my revelations overrides all else, even to the point of jeopardizing my own safety. 3 I have done something terrible in defense of my revelations that remains secret. For now. 4 I am completely dismissive of anyone who doesn’t accept my revelations. 5 I secretly hope that someone will silence me before the dread truth I speak comes to pass. 6 A rival of my faith speaks out against my revelations with a contradictory prophecy and hunts me across the land.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Midgard Heroes Handbook"},{"name":"Protector of the Tribe","description":"You grew up as part of a tribe that lives in unity with nature and the spirit world. At some point in your life, whether early or at a late age, the desire to protect your people became a driving force. You had a mentor supporting you and teaching you everything they knew. You not only learned to fight for yourself and others, but also to take care of your own equipment. Your tribe gladly accepted, maybe even honored you as a protector. If you decided to leave your tribe, there was a strong reason. Maybe you think the world beyond holds the key to the survival of your people. You might be on a search for new allies, knowledge or magic items. Or you are on a quest to follow one of the great legends of your tribe. You might even have received visions from the spirit world sending you on an important mission.

Ocasionally, you receive helpful dreams and visions assisting you on your path, or helping you find the right way when you are torn between decisions. Suggested characteristics: You are a deeply caring person, willing to risk your own life to protect those you love. You might fight for the greater good or simply for the survival of your tribe. Either way, you are convinced that you know how to best protect your people. And you are willing to dedicate your life to it. Traits The world has changed so much that the old traditions and beliefs are not enough to survive anymore. I am open to learning about this new world. I believe in the sacred ways of my culture, and want to preserve them by teaching others. The cataclysm has left me terrified, and I believe we have to prepare for greater dangers yet to come. I am guided by the spirit world, and I go wherever the spirits send me. I seek new wisdom, so both I and my tribe can grow. I have lost too many people since the apocalypse, and seeing the faces of my tribe every day only reminds me of those who didn’t make it. I feel like I am not yet worthy as a protector of the tribe, and I want to travel the world to become better. Since the world shifted to Braythe, I feel my own soul is not as attuned to the world as it was. I desire to travel the world to find answers, and become one with the land again. Ideals Spirituality. Everything and everyone has a soul worth saving. It is not always possible, but it is always worth the try. (Good) Society. The sacred ways of my tribe have to be preserved at all costs. (Lawful) Survival. After all my people have lost, we have to do whatever is necessary to secure our survival, even if the old ways forbid it. (Chaotic) Hatred. After all I have lost, there is no love or mercy left in me. (Evil) Adaptation. The world has changed so much, everything I have learned has to be reevaluated. (Neutral) Growth. I am aware of my shortcomings, and I seek to grow to become a better and more valuable person. (Any) Bonds I have a strong bond to my mentor, who might or might not have survived the last years. He made me promise something, and I intend to keep that promise. Someone killed a person I loved, and their face is etched forever in my mind. I will not rest until I have found the murderer. A member of my tribe that means a lot to me has gone missing. I will do everything to find them. The shaman of my tribe asked me to go on a quest of great importance for my people. The spirit world is as important to me as the world of the mortals. I had a dream vision that left me with an important task I need to fulfill. I seek for a wisdom I could not find in my own tribe, so I will travel the world in search of answers. Flaws I trust in the old ways or the spirit world so much that I sometimes make serious mistakes based on these beliefs. I can be overprotective at times, ignoring boundaries to make sure nothing happens to those I love. My spirituality influences my communication so much that others sometimes have a hard time understanding what I’m talking about. I am often guided by anger and pain, and lash out at innocents. I feel terrible guilt because I could not protect someone important to me. I have nightmares and flashbacks about the moment I lost them. I have lost so much that I feel the world owes me something in return, and now I take what I believe I deserve.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Public Intellectual","description":"You’re known for speaking out against—or in favor of—a regime, political organization, religious body, or other entity that holds state power.

You and your brothers and sisters of the Red Winter believe vampires have subverted the natural order of things by ruling over the living. Vampires have no blood except that which they take from the living. They are parasites. It is the living who are truly blessed by the Blood Goddess. Your order seeks vengeance on the parasites who have overreached their station, and you plan to put the scales back in balance. You and your fellow adherents will bring the Red Winter, a final, cold season when the snows run red with stolen blood, spilled from the thieves who took it.

The Betrayers sought to wipe the slate clean. At the end of that devastating war, the Prime Deities established a Divine Gate that would prevent all gods, good or evil, from directly affecting the world, but which would leave the gods’ mortal followers and supernal servants to enact their will. And so the corrupting whispers of the Betrayer Gods have ensnared the minds of power-hungry mortals for centuries, promising them a sliver of the gods’ great power in exchange for dedicating their souls to occult lore. You once belonged to such a cult of the Betrayer Gods. Perhaps this faith only briefly tempted your rebellious, youthful spirit. Perhaps the cult gave you love and family when you had none, asking only your adherence to their prophet in exchange. Or maybe you were raised from birth to pay homage to gods of selfish cruelty—until one fateful day the veil was lifted, so that nothing stood between you and the horrifying truth. However it happened, you were freed from the shackles of this poisonous sect. Yet you know that this group does not forgive betrayers. As long as you live, you will be hunted—and if the members of the cult think you dead, their hunt will begin again the second they learn they’re wrong. Skill Proficiencies: Deception and Religion Languages: One of your choice Equipment: Vestments and a holy symbol of your previous cult, a set of common clothes, a belt pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Fell Teachings You were inundated with knowledge about one of the Betrayer Gods, and know by heart everything from their basic commandments to some of their most esoteric secrets. Choose one of the Betrayer Gods described in chapter 2. You have advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to know information about their faith, including obscure secrets unknown to most worshipers. Additionally, you can work with your GM to create a secret that you learned during your time in the cult. This secret might be the seed of a conspiracy, a myth of a legendary hero whose true meaning has mutated over the years, or even the location of a fabled artifact of the gods. Suggested Characteristics The life of every former cultist is defined to some degree by the process of fleeing the past, and of trying to make a future away from the beliefs that once claimed them. Your bond is likely associated with those who gave you the insight and strength to flee your old ways. Your ideal might involve your desire to take down and destroy those who promote the evil you escaped, and perhaps finding new faith in a forgiving god. Reformed Cultist Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I need a dagger close at hand at all times. Just in case they find me. 2 I can’t believe I’m out here fighting monsters. After everything I’ve been through, why can’t I find a normal life? 3 I need a stiff drink before I do anything stressful these days. I know it’s a problem. Just…let me have this. 4 Murder is okay when it’s for a good cause! I didn’t tear my past out by the roots so I could let evil people cause more harm. 5 My past is filled with stories like you wouldn’t believe. Ones that’ll really make your skin crawl. Do you want to hear…? 6 Yeah, I’m crying. I do that. Get over yourself. 7 I know you’ve told me your name twice already, but that’s not good enough. How can I be sure you are who you say you are? 8 My mind is always racing. I can’t…I just need to…you have to give me a second—or else I can’t…organize my thoughts. Reformed Cultist Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Life. I’ve spent too long shackled to an evil master. No matter what happened before, I deserve my freedom now. (Chaotic) 2 Redemption. People can change, but redemption must be something they choose for themselves. If they do, it is my duty to help them along that path. (Good) 3 Power. When I abandoned the cult, it wasn’t out of some misguided sense of righteousness. That pathetic organization was merely a shackle on my potential. (Evil) 4 Vengeance. The cult has poisoned my life. I will see all its followers suffer. (Any) 5 Hierarchy. The cult was vile, but its strength was in stability and organization. As long as good folk lack unity, evil will always triumph. (Lawful) 6 Reparations. As a cultist, I harmed people whose names I’ll never know. I feel obligated to repay my debt by aiding others. (Good) Reformed Cultist Bonds d6 Bond 1 My cousin escaped the cult with me. I lost track of them when we fled, but I know they’re alive. I can feel it. 2 I was saved from the cult by a priest of one of the Prime Deities. If not for that sign of faith, I would surely be lost. 3 I was told by the person who saved me that a sage once said: “Life needs things to live.” I don’t know what that means, but I’ve dedicated my existence to finding out. 4 One of my cultist parents had a change of heart when I was a teenager, and we fled together in the dark of night. I didn’t want to leave, but I understand now that their courage saved my life. 5 I was bested by a warrior when I fumbled a cult-ordered assassination. I don’t know why that person took pity on me, but they gave me purpose when I was lost. 6 Now that I’ve saved myself, the only person important to me is my former cult leader—because I’ve sworn that they’ll die by my hand. Reformed Cultist Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I’m haunted by what I saw in those ritual chambers. Every time I see blood, I…oh, gods, I can’t bear to even think about it. 2 I ran from the cult long ago. But deep down, there’s a part of me that still thinks they were right about certain things. 3 I can’t help but feel a rush whenever I see a life snuffed out before me. Just one more kill…just one more. 4 Organized religion terrifies me. Betrayer Gods or Prime Deities…it doesn’t matter. The sight of the faithful freezes my blood cold. 5 Oh, I always tell the truth. Always. I’ve never had to keep a secret from anyone, so of course I’ll be open with you. 6 I don’t trust easily. If you grew up being lied to about every little thing? The fundamental nature of the world? You wouldn’t, either.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Darrington Press","book":"Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn"},{"name":"Refugee","description":"Sojourner dwarves like Okkar Ironeyes are likely to be born on the road, refugees of either a recent or ancient event that resulted in the loss of their homeland. The following background can be used by PCs who lived a similar existence prior to their adventuring careers. Refugee You have lost your home due to some natural disaster, act of war, magical cataclysm, or other form of widespread destruction. Forced to flee your home, you’ve spent a good portion of your life on the road looking for a new community that would accept you. As a result, you’ve learned to endure the hardships of a nomadic existence, traveling from place to place and earning a meager living to survive. Your dream of one day settling down for good has been long deferred, but you persevere, hoping to find acceptance somewhere—even if it means using force to stake your claim on a new home.

A set of artisan’s tools (one of your choice), a small wood axe, a two-person tent, a belt pouch containing 10 gp, a set of common clothes, and a token reminder of your former home (a pressed flower, a stone from your house, a tiny painting, etc.) Feature: Far-flung Friends The disaster that drove you from your home also affected your family, friends, and other members of your homeland, village, or clan. These fellow refugees dispersed across the landscape, taking up residence in numerous settlements both near and far, and they are always willing to extend a helping hand to another refugee in need of assistance. In communities that are now home to your kith and kin, you can count on housing, food, free advice, and other assistance so long as it doesn’t threaten the lives and well-being of those lending you aid. Your GM will decide whether or not a particular community has fellow refugees amongst its population. Suggested Characteristics A refugee has led a hard existence. Between the loss of his home and the constant travails of uncertain life on the road, the refugee seldom knows stability and kindness. This means that most refugees either cling close to the few people they can trust or they eschew all others, preferring to rely on the only one they feel will never let them down in a tight spot: themselves.

Survival is a serious matter. 8 I’ve had few companions on the road and tend to talk to myself and/or my mount to keep me company. D6 Ideal 1 Cooperation . You are only as strong as the weakest amongst you and must stand ready to assist others when they falter. (Good) 2 Stability . There is no greater aspiration in life than to possess a home or other place where one is safe and secure. (Lawful) 3 Self-Reliance . The ability to provide for oneself liberates you from the need to rely on others. (Chaotic) 4 Vigilance . One must constantly be on the lookout for danger or difficulty, and swift to intercede before it comes to fruition. (Neutral) 5 Might . If someone is not strong enough to hold what is theirs, you have every right to take it for your own. (Evil) 6 Faith . Trust in the gods to guide you through hardships and they shall eventually put you where they intend for you to be.

D6 Flaw 1 Having been bitterly disappointed in the past, I’m reluctant to trust others. 2 I am prone to looking out for myself first and foremost. 3 I am an easily swayed by someone with a hard luck story. 4 I had a role—either willingly or unwittingly--in the catastrophe that displaced my loved ones and I must hide my shameful secret. 5 I hoard every resource I can, be it money, magic, or food, for fear I might find myself lacking when I most need these things. 6 I have no respect for those who lead a life of luxury and leisure, untested by the hardships of life.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Goodman Games","book":"Glitterdoom (FEF 1)"},{"name":"Refugee","description":"You have been driven from your homeland by the ravening forces of the Shadow.

How much time did you spend adventuring before retirement? Who was your most-hated enemy? Who did you adventure with? Why did you hang it up? Something happened that made you lose your edge and finely honed adventuring skills. Has age or luxurious retirement made you soft? Did a physical or magical accident take some abilities from you?

You gain the Lucky, Magic Initiate, or Skilled feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects the transformation that changed your life. An encounter with a genie who gave you three wishes might have resulted in magical powers represented by Magic Initiate. If you paid off all your family debts with a fortuitous round of three-dragon ante, you might be Lucky instead. Alternatively, you could use the Skilled feat to reflect whatever trial you endured to secure your new destiny and to model the knowledge and abilities imparted to you by whatever force transformed your life. Building a Rewarded Character Rewarded characters have varied histories, but they have one thing in common: they were down on their luck before their lives abruptly turned around. They might have given up all hope of a happier life, only to suddenly get a second chance. A rewarded character has often spent many years struggling to escape painful circumstances. Now, extricated from the (sometimes literal) prison that was their former life, they throw their cares to the wind and become adventurers. If your character’s life was changed by a Deck of Many Things , consider which card was responsible. Perhaps the Fates card undid a tragic mistake your character made in their youth. The Gem card could have wiped out debts incurred over a lifetime. Maybe the Sage card provided the advice needed to escape a hopeless situation, the Star card increased an ability score to its current value, or a Wish spell cast after drawing the Moon card transformed your character from a peddler to a fledgling sorcerer infused with magic and new knowledge and skills. If you’re making a character at higher than 1st level, magic items they have could have been granted by the Key or Sun card. Suggested Characteristics. Your character’s perspective on life has changed thanks to their new destiny.

Minus the corruption, of course. 7 I often try to make conversation with commoners, trying to understand their perspective. 8 I sometimes use my title to intimidate people into giving me goods. d6 Ideal 1 Guardian. I only wish to protect my kingdom. It means everything to me. (Any) 2 Keeper of Order. It is my duty as a royal to make sure that my family's legacy and traditions endure through the ages. (Lawful) 3 Royal Right. I am free to do as I wish. After all, who has the right to stop me? (Chaotic) 4 Benevolent. No matter what, the well-being of all my subjects is the most important thing. (Good) 5 Indifferent. My place as a royal is happenstance. I don't feel as if it makes me more special than anyone else. (Neutral) 6 Tyrant. I am above the peasantry, their lives are little more than resources for me to do with as I wish. (Evil) d6 Bond 1 I inherited the throne from my parents when I was but a child. I wish I had gotten to know my parents better. 2 I spent most of my life within the castle grounds, never seeing beyond those pristine stone walls. 3 I had a mentor, who was more like family than my own parents. They died protecting me from a plot against my life. 4 I met a famous adventurer while I was young. They inspired me to go beyond the cushy life in this castle. 5 My siblings and cousins have tried to end my life for a chance at the crown. They will receive no mercy. 6 I met a peasant child who became my greatest friend and confidant. They are responsible for my adventurous spirit. d6 Flaw 1 There's a humiliating secret in my upbringing that I'd never talk about, if possible. 2 My kingdom's treasures are much too valuable. I cannot trust anyone to protect them properly. 3 I am much too naive to be a decent politician. 4 My kingdom is the most powerful. We don't need to rely on anyone else. 5 I never completed the obligatory high education of a royal. 6 If I could, I'd sell my position as a royal to the nearest poor bastard.

You had a life of luxury, love, and comfort when you suddenly lost it all. Perhaps you were framed for crimes you didn’t commit and lost your reputation, fortune, and career. Maybe a rampaging dragon or another monster wiped out everything you had in a single calamitous afternoon. Or you might have sought out a Deck of Many Things , hoping to make your successful life even more glorious—only to draw a destructive card that changed your destiny forever. Your desperation has driven you to the career of adventurer. You don’t seek out dark dungeons and their monstrous inhabitants for excitement and glory; you do it because every other path is closed to you. But you have risen high on fortune’s wheel once before, and with luck and fortitude, you could do so again. Skill Proficiencies: Stealth, Survival Languages: One of your choice Tool Proficiencies: One gaming set of your choice (such as playing cards or three-dragon ante cards) Equipment: A cracked hourglass, a set of rusty manacles, a half-empty bottle, a hunting trap, a gaming set (matching your chosen proficiency), a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 13 gp Feature: Still Standing You have weathered ruinous misfortune, and you possess hidden reserves others don’t expect. You gain the Alert, Skilled, or Tough feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects how you’ve dealt with the terrible loss that changed your life forever. If you’ve kept your senses sharp for every opportunity and climbed your way out of misery by seizing the tiniest scrap of hope, choose Alert. If you’ve redoubled your efforts to reclaim what was once yours, choose Skilled. If you’ve stoically persevered through your misfortune, select Tough. Building a Ruined Character Ruined characters were on top of the world before misfortune struck. Many were wealthy. Others come from modest backgrounds, but they were surrounded by friends, family, and loved ones. They might have been famous, or simply never encountered serious hardship before. Some were born to privilege or rose to prominence through trickery or a false reputation. Now a Deck of Many Things —or another calamity—has knocked them down like a house of cards. If your character’s life was ruined by a Deck of Many Things , consider which card was responsible. Perhaps your character was imprisoned for years by the Donjon or Void card, and now everyone they knew has died. Maybe your character drew the Rogue card, and the person closest to them—a spouse, child, or parent—turned against them. A devil unleashed by the Flames card might have destroyed their life. The Ruin or Talons card might have stolen the character’s material goods or saddled them with vast debt. Suggested Characteristics. Rising above misfortune shapes one’s perspective. The Ruined Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character (and ruinous cards that might have prompted this trait). Ruined Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I’ve changed from my past, and I work to live up to my new path. (Balance, Throne) 2 Every moment is a gift I refuse to squander. (Euryale, Skull) 3 Now that I’ve overcome having nothing, I can survive anything. (Fool, Ruin, Talons) 4 I know enemies are set against me, and I always prepare for the worst. (Flames, Rogue) 5 I interpret every event as part of a larger pattern I just haven’t worked out yet. (Puzzle, Star) 6 I must make up for so much time I’ve already lost. (Donjon, Void) Ruined Trinkets. When you make your character, you can roll once on the Ruined Trinkets table instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook .

You learned to torture, to kill. But there was a moment where you just couldn't stand it anymore. Or maybe it was just a moment of opportunity, the chance to escape that you had been looking for so long. You deserted your home and your culture, leaving everything behind but what you could carry on your body. Harsh as your new life might be, it is better than what you came from. But not everything is good: You know your former friends and family will not simply let you go. You are hunted, and you are aware of it. Not only do you prefer to hide your true identity, you also choose friends that can defend themselves. One day, facing your past might become inevitable. Until then, you have to grow strong, and find companions willing and capable to help you. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Intimidation Tool Proficiencies and Languages: Disguise Kit, and either Thieves' Tools or Forgery Kit Equipment: A pouch containing 5 gp A set of commoner's clothes A Dungeoneer's Pack or an Explorer's Pack A forged document or signet ring identifying you as a fake persona Gut feeling: You're always on the lookout for people hunting you, while disguising yourself in public many times. This trained you in seeing through disguises and deceits. You often have a hunch when something is \"off\" about a person, whether they are disguised, lie to you or just generally might pose a threat to you. Suggested characteristics: You cannot stand evil and cruelty. If you don't fight it, you at least try to get away from it. At the same time, you were forced to do horrible things in the past, and if you feel pressured enough, your old habits might resurface. You're trying your best to be a better person, but it's not always easy. Some might also call you a bit paranoid - but is it really paranoia when you know you're hunted? Traits Cruelty exists not only in evil societies. I notice even small signs of abuse and neglect, and I despise what I see. I have seen - and inflicted - so much suffering that I feel I have to outweigh these experiences. That's why I care so deeply, especially for those who can't defend themselves. I have lost all friends and family from the past. I might be cautious about letting someone new in, but once I do, my emotional bonds are strong. To me, there are only three kinds of people: The ones I trust, the ones I consider harmless, and the ones that are potentially dangerous. I always keep an eye out for the great dangers - to me and to the entire world. I've been on the run for so long, running away has become my daily life. I have turned my escape into a game. I love leaving false trails, confusing potential pursuers and proving to myself I can get away from anyone. I have a problem with people in power. Even if I'm smart enough to not show it outright, I do believe the desire for power stems from a desire to harm or utilize others. Ideals Liberation. Those who can't defend themselved need to be liberated from those who harm them. (Good) Strict rules. Everyone has the capacity to do horrible things. Only the strict enforcement of rules keeps people from harming each other. (Lawful) Disobedience. A lot of evil stems from good people obeying evil ones. Disobedience breaks the power of malicious rulers. (Chaotic) Survival. I've done bad things to survive. I'm not above doing it again. And if I'm totally honest... I even enjoy it a little. (Evil) Free Choice. I know how horrible it is to be forced to act in a way that doesn't match your beliefs and feelings. The freedom of choice, even if it leads to evil, is my highest ideal. (Neutral) Inner healing. Most of my scars aren't visible - they are part of my mind and soul. But I'm on a journey of healing, and I'll help anyone who's on the same journey. (Any) Bonds There was someone who helped me escape my home. I swore I will come back for them. In my old life, there was one person in particular responsible for a lot of my suffering. I'll have my revenge when I'm ready to face them again. Someone escaped together with me, but at a moment of danger, they betrayed me to save themselves. I'm going to find them and make them pay. When I found my way into civilization again, there was one person in particular who helped me, and who knows my secrets. I would die for that person. I found philosophical books from a particular author that helped me heal and find myself. To me, this author is an idol, and it would be a dream to meet that person. When I came into more civilized lands, I needed a fake identity. The criminal contact that helped me became a friend, and one of the few people who know my secret. Flaws When meeting someone new, I'm very cautious. I can play friendly roles, but I don't open up my true self easily. I can't stand by when I see cruelty and abuse of power. The need to do something against it can feel overwhelming sometimes. I need to numb myself. The memories of the past are so painful that I've become addicted to alcohol, gambling or similar things. I can be ruthless. I've done horrible things in the past. I prefer not to, but if necessary, I can switch off my mercy. I'm guilty. I can't stand thinking about the things I've done, and the feelings of shame and guilt accompany me every day. I'm socially awkward. I've grown up in a society I now reject, but I'm just beginning to learn how to act around people in other societies.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Rune Carver","description":"What we call rune magic is the palest imitation of Annam's creative work.

Whether you were taught by a master rune carver or learned by poring over ancient engravings, you can tap into the supernatural power held within runes.

Whether tilling the fields of gentle plains or clearing forests to make use of nutrient-rich soil, a flat, even field represents the taming of the wilds. Food is the core of any prosperous civilization, and without fertile land entire empires quickly crumble. Food is a force that can both unify and stratify people; all must eat, but the luxury of exotic spices, fruits, or vegetables sets the wealthy apart. Poets exalt the serenity of the quiet countryside, the whisper of grass and grain in the wind, and the tranquility of hard work tilling the soil. Some governmental officials move to rural areas for the peace and quiet. Some even think themselves rustic despite their servants and elegant mansions. This tranquility is sometimes temporary, however: armies may march across fields and plains, destroying grass and crops, churning these symbols of civilization into broken sod. If a natural disaster tears through isolated countryside, roads become impassable, crops fail, and the land becomes wild. The farmers suffer the most when wars, disasters, and governmental neglect destroy their livelihood. Farmers tame the land and carry the weight of civilization on their backs. They keenly understand the balance between nature and humanity. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, choose one other Wisdom-based skill (Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, or Survival).

Regardless of the details, everyone had a hard life where you grew up and they blame your family as the cause of their troubles.

Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a tool you are proficient in, and a purse containing 20 gp Sinful Upbringing Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate awful act that your family is responsible for, and how much power they still wield today. Choose or randomly determine your parents’ sin: D8 Parents’ Sin 1 My family has ruled as tyrants for generations. 2 One of my parents assassinated a benevolent queen, plunging the kingdom into anarchy. 3 Sometimes magical experiments go wrong and blight the land. My parents should have cared. 4 It turns out the family business was running the thieves’ guild, preying on everyone. 5 Daddy made a deal with an archfiend to seize power. 6 My parents ran a guild and squeezed workers’ pay. 7 My parents brought a cult to town, and the cult took over. 8 Some foolish ancestors taunted an evil dragon. It has stayed around to rule us ever since. Upbringing in Shadow After establishing what your family has done, think about how your character feels about it. The scion of sin is shaped by the past and the difficulties of establishing an independent identity and reputation. Choose or randomly determine your reason for adventuring: D6 Why Adventure? 1 I want to rebel against my upbringing, and the best option is to be a do-gooder adventurer. 2 My homeland was destroyed, so I will risk my life to leave. 3 There are too many painful memories at home. Adventure keeps those thoughts at bay. 4 I learned setting out on my own is the only way to make a reputation to rise in the ranks. 5 My parents let loose a powerful evil that killed them. I will find a way to defeat it. 6 I was raised away from home. Now I’m returning to see if the evil rumors are true. Whatever your ancestors did is well known and infamous throughout the land. Think about whether you are immediately recognizable as a result. Do you need to walk the streets in disguise? If your family has a coat of arms, symbol, or other visual markers, would you ever wear them? Lastly, if your parents or some evil they spawned is still alive, talk to your DM about possible characters who could enter the campaign. These connections help establish your family and their evil legacy as features of the world of the campaign. Feature: I Speak Underling Your knowledge of how evil organizations work lets you gain access to the inner workings of such organizations. You can easily learn who the movers and shakers are, how to best approach them, and what their primary nefarious plots are. Unless you show other intentions, these groups will treat you as a valuable potential recruit. Suggested Characteristics Growing up in the shadow of evildoers who happen to be your family is a very different lifestyle than most experience. The personality of a scion of sin tends to be shaped by seeing the inner workings of how power is used and by living around suffering. Some become relatively detached from society and focus on their own survival, while others adopt very strong moral codes. D8 Personality Trait 1 I hate being around people, because it reminds me of what my family did. 2 No one knows the difference between right and wrong like I do! 3 My hands are so dirty already. I must solve issues myself. 4 People will do my bidding. Sometimes they are even aware of it. 5 I can’t trust anyone with wealth or power. 6 If you insult me, I will not rest until I bring you ruin. 7 It isn’t worth caring what happens to most people.

All seafarers respect and fear the sea, and take great pains to ensure they have paid proper tribute to the gods and spirits of the ocean before a voyage. Seafarers play a unique role in the social hierarchy and economy of the world. Are you a navy officer? A merchant trader? A ruthless pirate? Why have you set foot on land? Why now? Was your ship destroyed, by storm, god, or pirate? Do you wish to return to your place of birth? Whatever the reason, you've decided to leave your old life behind, at least for now.

Feature: Sea Brotherhood The Sea Brotherhood is a group of priests, druids, sailors and shamans who have a strong presence across much of the ocean, and significant influence over trade. You are a low-ranking member, but still have enough power to sway minor officials, or intimidate other sailors by invoking their name. By using this connection you are able to acquire information in port towns and fishing villages about rumors, tales of pirates or travelers from other lands and about remarkable vessels and crews that may be on shore leave.

Seers are rare individuals endowed with the gift to see beyond the mundane veil cloaking the world to the truth illuminated by those stars.

You must spend one hour in conversation with the subject and consultation with your divination method. At the end of this time you can offer insight into the subject’s possible future. These details are always vague, but the reading affords you the chance to gain insight into your subject and possibly enter their good graces. After giving a reading, you can expect a client to be more relaxed and willing to favorably consider any proposal you make (treat them as one category more favorable for purposes of social interaction).

As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you are surrounded by people and other creatures who share your worldview and your longing for deeper spiritual communion with the world, and you have a fervent desire to share the joy you have experienced with Ravnica. Along with the rest of the conclave, you are committed to resisting the ambitions of the other guilds—with military force if necessary. Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Persuasion Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument Languages: Choose one of Elvish, Loxodon, or Sylvan Equipment: A Selesnya insignia, a healer’s kit, robes, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp ( Azorius 1-zino coins) Feature: Conclave’s Shelter As a member of the Selesnya Conclave , you can count on your guild mates to provide shelter and aid. You and your companions can find a place to hide or rest in any Selesnya enclave in the city, unless you have proven to be a danger to them. The members of the enclave will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives in this effort. In addition, as a guild member you can receive free healing and care at a Selesnya enclave, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Selesnya Guild Spells Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Selesnya Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

A sensation of gentle warmth and the smell of spring flowers or autumn leaves might accompany your spells. Suggested Characteristics Most members of the Selesnya Conclave are true believers—the tight-knit community allows little room for the cynical or disillusioned. They are spiritual, empathetic, and generally peaceful—unless roused to action. Their flaws and bonds alike grow naturally from their close ties to the community. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I never raise my voice or lose my temper. 2 I feel the pains and joys of everyone around me, friend or foe. 3 I would rather make a friend than thwart an enemy. 4 I’m always straining to peer into another reality that seems to be just beyond my senses. 5 I’m uneasy if I can’t see plants growing or feel soil beneath my feet. 6 Seeing illness or injury in any creature saddens me. 7 I have much to be proud of, but I am still just one strand in the grand, interwoven tapestry of life. 8 Nature offers rich and abundant metaphors for understanding the complexities of life. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Harmony. Nothing is more beautiful than voices and actions aligned in common purpose. (Good) 3 Order. Like a well-pruned tree, society thrives when everything is kept in good order. (Lawful) 4 Life. Preserving life and nature is always a worthwhile endeavor. (Good) 5 Humility. Ambition and pride are the roots of strife. (Good) 6 Evangelism. When all have joined the Selesnya Conclave , Ravnica will finally know peace. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I would give my life in the defense of the small enclave where I first encountered Mat’Selesnya. 2 I love beasts and plants of all kinds, and am loath to harm them. 3 A healer nursed me to recovery from a mortal illness. 4 I’ll sing the invitation of Mat’Selesnya with my dying breath. 5 I cherish a leaf from Vitu-Ghazi that changes color with the seasons, even though it is no longer attached to the tree. 6 Every member of the conclave is my kin, and I would fight for any one of them. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I’m terrified of getting into a fight where my side is outnumbered. 2 I assume that people mean well until they prove otherwise. 3 I enjoy comfort and quiet, and prefer to avoid extra effort. 4 I have a fierce temper that doesn’t reflect the inner calm I seek. 5 I’m convinced that everyone else in the conclave has a deeper connection to the Worldsoul than I do. 6 I’m trying to atone for the life of crime I led before I joined the Selesnya , but I find it hard to give up my bad habits.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica"},{"name":"Sentry","description":"In your youth, the defense of the city, the community, the caravan, or your patron was how you earned your coin. You might have been trained by an old, grizzled city watchman, or you might have been pressed into service by the local magistrate for your superior skills, size, or intellect. However you came to the role, you excelled at defending others. You have a nose for trouble, a keen eye for spotting threats, a strong arm to back it up, and you are canny enough to know when to act. Most importantly, though, you were a peace officer or a protector and not a member of an army which might march to war. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set Languages: One language of your choice Equipment: A set of dice or deck of cards, a shield bearing your previous employer’s symbol, a set of common clothes, a hooded lantern, a signal whistle, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Specialization Each person or location that hires a sentry comes with its own set of unique needs and responsibilities. As a sentry, you fulfilled one of these unique roles. Choose a specialization or roll a d6 and consult the table below to define your expertise as a sentry. d6 Specialization 1 City or gate watch 2 Bodyguard or jailor 3 Caravan guard 4 Palace or judicial sentry 5 Shop guard 6 Ecclesiastical or temple guard Feature: Comrades in Arms The knowing look from the caravan guard to the city gatekeeper or the nod of recognition between the noble’s bodyguard and the district watchman—no matter the community, city, or town, the guards share a commonality of purpose. When you arrive in a new location, you can speak briefly with the gate guards, local watch, or other community guardians to gain local knowledge. This knowledge could be information, such as the most efficient routes through the city, primary vendors for a variety of luxury goods, the best (or worst) inns and taverns, the primary criminal elements in town, or the current conflicts in the community. Suggested Characteristics You’re a person who understands both patience and boredom, as a guard is always waiting for something to happen. More often than not, sentries hope nothing happens because something happening usually means something has gone wrong. A life spent watching and protecting, acting in critical moments, and learning the details of places and behaviors; all of these help shape the personality of the former sentry. Some claim you never stop being a guard, you just change what you protect. d8 Personality Trait 1 I’ve seen the dregs of society and nothing surprises me anymore. 2 I know where to look to spot threats lurking around a corner, in a glance, and even in a bite of food or cup of drink. 3 I hate standing still and always keep moving. 4 My friends know they can rely on me to stand and protect them. 5 I resent the rich and powerful; they think they can get away with anything. 6 A deception of any sort marks you as untrustworthy in my mind. 7 Stopping lawbreakers taught me the best ways to skirt the law. 8 I never take anything at face-value. d6 Ideal 1 Greed. Threats to my companions only increase my glory when I protect them from it. (Evil) 2 Perception. I watch everyone, for threats come from every rank or station. (Neutral) 3 Duty. The laws of the community must be followed to keep everyone safe. (Lawful) 4 Community. I am all that stands between my companions and certain doom. (Good) 5 Determination. To truly protect others, you must sometimes break the law. (Chaotic) 6 Practicality. I require payment for the protection or service I provide. (Any) d6 Bond 1 My charge is paramount; if you can’t protect your charge, you’ve failed. 2 I was once saved by one of my fellow guards. Now I always come to my companions’ aid, no matter what the threat. 3 My oath is unbreakable; I’d rather die first. 4 There is no pride equal to the accomplishment of a successful mission. 5 I stand as a bulwark against those who would damage or destroy society, and society is worth protecting. 6 I know that as long as I stand with my companions, things can be made right. d6 Flaw 1 Sometimes I may overindulge in a guilty pleasure, but you need something to pass time. 2 I can’t just sit quietly next to someone. I’ve got to fill the silence with conversation to make good company. 3 I’m not very capable in social situations. I’d rather sit on the sidelines and observe. People make me nervous. 4 I have a tough time trusting strangers and new people. You don’t know their habits and behaviors; therefore, you don’t know their risk. 5 There is danger all around us, and only the foolish let their guard down. I am no fool, and I will spot the danger. 6 I believe there’s a firm separation between task and personal time. I don’t do other people’s work when I’m on my own time. If you want me, hire me.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Tome of Heroes"},{"name":"Seppun Family - Imperial Court","description":"The Seppun family can trace its origins to the very dawn of the Empire, and their founder, a wise-woman and diviner called Seppun, was said to have been Hantei’s first follower and friend in the Mortal Realm. Seppun was instrumental to Hantei’s ascension, helping him navigate the politics of the region and attain power. She also stood as his bodyguard, protecting him from numerous physical threats over the years. This devotion has continued ever since, leading the Seppun to become the foremost defenders of the Emperor and the group charged with security of the Imperial City. They are always prepared to fight to protect the Emperor. To facilitate carrying out their duty, the Seppun have established two basic types of protectors: the Palace Guard, or Seppun Honor Guard, and the Hidden Guard. The Palace Guard are among the most accomplished warriors in the Empire, and dedicate their martial arts and security training to protecting the Imperial line. The Hidden Guard, on the other hand, is made up of ritualists skilled in warding against the many supernatural threats to the Emperor. Using astrology and powerful invocations, they are capable of predicting and eliminating many threats before they even come to pass.

You know Imperial history quite well, particularly as it pertains to the deeds of the Emperor and the Imperial families. You know proper etiquette and protocol in the Imperial Capital. You know certain secrets that have been elided from the official histories of Rokugan.

This mark isn’t noticeable to most creatures, but genies and elementals sense that you have spent time at the courts of the jinn and are favorably disposed toward you when you first interact with them. Your affinity for jinn and geniekind also makes it easier for you to identify their influence on the world. You have advantage on Intelligence checks or saving throws to recognize items and magic created by genies and to see through their illusions and trickery. Suggested Characteristics The wonders witnessed by the servants of the jinn often shape their outlook on life once they return to their homes in the Southlands. Time spent on the elemental planes can create powerful bonds or lead to unusual quirks. d8 Personality Trait 1 I always bow deeply to show respect to those in authority. 2 I miss the hustle and bustle and splendor of the court. 3 You hear a lot of strange things when you’re standing on guard outside the seraglio. 4 Cutting corners just creates more corners. Do it properly or don’t do it all. 5 I worked for three days with only an hour’s sleep to make sure my master’s party was the most sensational ever thrown. I’d do it all over again in a heartbeat. 6 You can get away with a lot if you flash a winning smile while you do it. 7 Life was much easier when I had someone constantly telling me what to do. 8 Be careful what you wish for, particularly when an efreeti is the one granting the wish. d6 Ideal 1 Professionalism.

Through divine vision granted by the Fortune of Bonds, Musubi, the members of the Deer Clan uncover threads of futures yet to come. Through artful stealth, they weave or sever these threads in the delicate tapestry to head off potential crises before they come to fruition. The clan’s matchmakers are ritualists blessed with unique insights into relationships. These help them to tie alliances between the Great Clans and Imperial families—or to unwind them, should calamitous portents be seen in a meeting between two individuals or a treaty between two clans. The clan’s speardancers are fleeting protectors, shinobi sent to guard individuals whose fates the clan deems important, yet they are rarely noticed by their charges. The Deer Clan’s influence on the Empire is subtle, for when their job is done correctly, only the Deer Clan’s members know they have done it at all.

Although they do not yet know why, the naga who inhabit the Shinomen Forest collectively feel the pull of a great destiny that awaits them beyond the woods. The dream is broken, and at last, these naga prepare to rejoin the world outside. Naga rarely adorn themselves with clothing in the human sense, but that does not mean that they do not decorate themselves. Shinomen naga prefer instead to wear trinkets, jewels, and intricate segmented coverings made from seashells, coral, and worked metal. When in need of additional coverings, a long sash of sea silk, made from the beards of a unique species of freshwater clam, serves this purpose. Such clothing is always light and minimal, so as not to hinder movement or skin contact with the water.

Pragmatic out of necessity, but always seeking to provide the best possible care for their patients, shipboard medics are natural candidates to be made clerics of healing gods, and often possess an intellectual capacity well-suited to the demands of wizardry.

You once helped build a fishing vessel that single-handedly saved a town from starvation. You have seen a majestic prow in your dreams that you have not been able to replicate in wood. Since childhood, you have loved the water and have been captivated by the many vessels that travel on it. Skill Proficiencies: History, Perception Tool Proficiencies: Carpenter’s tools, vehicles (water) Equipment: A set of well-loved carpenter’s tools, a blank book, 1 ounce of ink, an ink pen, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a leather pouch with 10 gp Feature: I’ll Patch It! Provided you have carpenter’s tools and wood, you can perform repairs on a water vehicle. When you use this ability, you restore a number of hit points to the hull of a water vehicle equal to 5 × your proficiency modifier. A vehicle cannot be patched by you in this way again until after it has been pulled ashore and fully repaired. Life at Sea Your life at sea and in port has shaped you; you can roll on the following table to determine its impact or choose an element that best fits your character. d6 Influence 1 Grand Designs. You are working on plans and schematics for a new, very fast ship. You must examine as many different kinds of vessels as possible to help ensure the success of your design. 2 Solid and Sound. You patched up a war galley and prevented it from sinking. The local navy regards you as a friend. 3 Favored. You insisted on thicker planking for a merchant vessel’s hull, which saved it from sinking when it smashed against a reef. You have a standing invitation to visit the merchant’s distant mansion. 4 Master of Armaments. You specialized in designing and mounting defenses for the navy. You easily recognize and determine the quality of such items. 5 Low Places. You have contacts in the smuggling outfits along the coast; you occasionally repair the criminals’ ships in exchange for coin and favors. 6 Mysteries of the Deep. You experienced an encounter with a possibly divine being while sailing alone. Work with your DM to determine the secret about the deep waters of the sea that this entity revealed to you. Suggested Characteristics Shipwrights are resourceful carpenters and designers. They often have a dedicated spot at the local tavern, since shipwrights are invaluable to coastal communities. Some travel with naval fleets and might serve as officers if their temperament suits it. Shipwrights have an affinity for working with their hands and often perform feats of carpentry that others might deem miraculous. Shipwright Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I love talking and being heard more than I like to listen. 2 I’m extremely fond of puzzles. 3 I thrive under pressure. 4 I love sketching and designing objects, especially boats. 5 I’m not afraid of hard work—in fact, I prefer it. 6 A pipe, an ale, and the smell of the sea: paradise. 7 I have an endless supply of cautionary tales related to the sea. 8 I don’t mind getting my hands dirty.

Shipwright Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I don’t know when to throw something away. You never know when it might be useful again. 2 I get frustrated to the point of distraction by shoddy craftsmanship. 3 Though I am an excellent crafter, my work tends to look as though it belongs on a ship. 4 I am so obsessed with sketching my ideas for elaborate inventions that I sometimes forget little thing like eating and sleeping. 5 I’m judgmental of those who are not skilled with tools of some kind. 6 I sometimes take things that don’t belong to me, especially if they are very well made.

Little does the Empire realize how fully the Shosuro embrace their roles; many of the finest Scorpion spies are Shosuro living as other people among the clans, watching them for any sign of treachery against the Imperial Throne. While Shosuro students are trained to be master entertainers, and their family school is officially an acting academy, they are often asked to turn their skills in acrobatics, acting, and other arts to subterfuge, deception, and even assassination.

That’s the world you have been trying to grow in the laboratories of the Simic Combine . Nature is all about adaptation, evolution, and balance—but for it to keep up with the pace of advancing civilization, nature needs some help from biomancers and terraformers. If, along the way, you happen to create super-soldiers and mutant monsters that can bolster the combine’s defenses against the schemes and ambitions of the other guilds, so much the better.

Usually, this information comes from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes from an Izzet facility, a library, a university, or an independent scholar or other learned person or creature. Knowing where the information can be found doesn’t automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets.

Feature: Worldly You know the local deserts, their cultures, and the customs of those people. You know where and when nomadic tribes typically pass through certain areas, which tribes claim which oasis at what time of year, and where food and water can likely be found (though no guarantee). You also have one trade contact with a group or individual outside of your tribe. This contact may be friendly or barely tolerated, but trade between rival camps is a necessity for survival in the harsh environments. You know when and where this contact will be at any time of year and can send messages to this contact even over great distances; you know the local messengers, caravan masters, and runners who can carry messages for you. Suggested Characteristics Siwali tradesmen and caravanners travel among the great cities of the Southlands, carrying dates, rare flowers, spices, salt, herbs, and other trade goods. Adventurers with this background are used to a range of cultures, languages, and laws and are typically a curious lot. Wanderlust swings from one extreme to the other—you either become anxious and antsy staying in one town or city for more than a few weeks, or you have tired of life on the open road and long for a permanent home, friends, and family. d8 Personality Trait 1 I’m driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home. 2 I’m rude to people who lack my commitment to hard work and fair play. 3 I don’t part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible. 4 I am utterly serene; panic won’t protect you from a sandstorm. 5 My friends know they can rely on me; teamwork is survival in a caravan. 6 I never pass up a friendly wager. 7 Don’t let the truth get in the way of a good story. 8 I judge people by their actions, not their words. d6 Ideal 1 Freedom. Everyone should be free to travel and to pursue their own destiny. (Chaotic) 2 People. I’m committed to the people I care about, not to ideals. (Neutral) 3 Greed. I’m only in it for the money. (Evil) 4 Fairness. Order, teamwork, and fair treatment are the foundations of caravan survival. (Lawful) 5 Live and Let Live.

(Any) d6 Bond 1 Nothing is more important than the other members of my caravan. 2 I owe my life to the trader who raised me after my family died. 3 I long for the days when I can travel to my love’s home settlement. If only they had my love of the open road. 4 I was once cheated out of my fair share of profits and I’ll get what’s due me. 5 The caravan itself is the most important thing—masters, guards, and servants come and go. 6 I joined the caravans to avoid those who may still be hunting me. One day, I will be ready to confront them. d6 Flaw 1 Gossip shatters bonds built by action. I don’t talk, I do. 2 Life is lonely on the road. I have an insatiable desire for the pleasures of civilization. 3 I’ll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless. 4 No one can know I once stole from the caravan; betrayal on the road means death by eviction. 5 I have trouble keeping my thoughts to myself; my tongue often lands me in trouble. 6 I am suspicious of strangers and always think the worst of them.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Kobold Press","book":"Southlands Player's Guide"},{"name":"Smuggler","description":"Smuggler On a rickety barge, you carried a hundred longswords in fish barrels right past the dock master’s oblivious lackeys. You have paddled a riverboat filled with stolen elven wine under the gaze of the moon and sold it for twice its value in the morning. In your more charitable times, you have transported innocents out of war zones or helped guide herd animals to safety on the banks of a burning river. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Deception Tool Proficiencies: Vehicles (water) Equipment: A fancy leather vest or a pair of leather boots, a set of common clothes, and a leather pouch with 15 gp Feature: Down Low You are acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help you out of tight situations. While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM’s discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a safe house, you can choose to keep your presence (and that of your companions) a secret. Claim to Fame Every smuggler has that one tale that sets them apart from common criminals. By wits, sailing skill, or a silver tongue, you lived to tell the story—and you tell it often. You can roll on the following table to determine your claim or choose one that best fits your character. d6 Accomplishment 1 Spirit of the Whale. You smuggled stolen dwarven spirits in the body of a dead whale being pulled behind a fishing boat. When you delivered the goods, the corpse suddenly exploded, sending whale meat and whiskey bottles for half a mile. 2 Cart and Sword. You drove a cart filled with stolen art through the middle of a battlefield while singing sea shanties to confuse the combatants. 3 The Recruit. You enlisted in another nation’s navy for the purpose of smuggling stolen jewels to a distant port. You attained a minor rank before disappearing from the navy and making your way here. 4 River of Shadows. Your riverboat accidentally slipped through the veil into the Shadowfell for several hours. While you were there, you sold some stolen dragonborn artifacts before returning to this plane and paddling home. 5 Gold-Hearted. You agreed to transport a family escaping a war. The baby began to cry at a checkpoint, and you gave the guards all your gold to let you pass. The family never found out about this gesture. 6 Playing Both Sides. You once smuggled crates of crossbow bolts and bundles of arrows, each destined for an opposing side in a regional war, at the same time. The buyers arrived within moments of each other but did not discover your trickery. Suggested Characteristics In general, smugglers value survival, and then profit, above other things. One could be a part of a larger organization, or might run a small smuggling vessel of their own. Smugglers live the lies they have told, and they have a natural ability to recall all the falsehoods and half-truths they have ever spouted. Smuggler Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I love being on the water but hate fishing. 2 I think of everything in terms of monetary value. 3 I never stop smiling. 4 Nothing rattles me; I have a lie for every occasion. 5 I love gold but won’t cheat a friend. 6 I enjoy doing things others believe to be impossible. 7 I become wistful when I see the sun rise over the ocean. 8 I am no common criminal; I am a mastermind. Smuggler Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Wealth. Heaps of coins in a secure vault is all I dream of. (Any) 2 Smuggler’s Code. I uphold the unwritten rules of the smugglers, who do not cheat one another or directly harm innocents. (Lawful) 3 All for a Coin. I’ll do nearly anything if it means I turn a profit. (Evil) 4 Peace and Prosperity. I smuggle only to achieve a greater goal that benefits my community. (Good) 5 People. For all my many lies, I place a high value on friendship. (Any) 6 Daring. I am most happy when risking everything. (Any) Smuggler Bonds d6 Bond 1 My vessel was stolen from me, and I burn with the desire to recover it. 2 I intend to become the leader of the network of smugglers that I belong to. 3 I owe a debt that cannot be repaid in gold. 4 After one last job, I will retire from the business. 5 I was tricked by a fellow smuggler who stole something precious from me. I will find that thief. 6 I give most of my profits to a charitable cause, and I don’t like to brag about it. Smuggler Flaws d6 Flaw 1 Lying is reflexive, and I sometimes engage in it without realizing. 2 I tend to assess my relationships in terms of profit and loss. 3 I believe everyone has a price and am cynical toward those who present themselves as virtuous. 4 I struggle to trust the words of others. 5 Few people know the real me. 6 Though I act charming, I feel nothing for others and don’t know what friendship is.

For generations, the Soshi family has trained the most subtle illusionists in Rokugan, whose carefully crafted façades are nearly impossible to detect, even for other ritualists. They are most effective when unseen, offering up prayers in silence for the Scorpion Clan. The Soshi live for subtlety, the gentle nudge, the whispered word that sets everything into motion. Sometimes this comes at a price, however, for their preference for acting at the perfect moment often makes them exceedingly cautious and prone to excessive planning and information gathering.

Weapon Proficiencies: Wakizashi. Languages: You can read, sign, speak, and write Rokugani, Courtly Rokugani, and one other common language of your choice. Equipment: Traveling clothes, unremarkable garb, wakizashi, mask, any one artisan tool or mystic implement, any one tool of subterfuge, and 10 gp.

Put the rest of your levels into ritualist, or consider putting six levels into the acolyte class to pursue the Acolyte of Shadow archetype, giving your character a plethora of strange abilities derived from their shadow brand. Soshi Shadow Agent Quick Build If you want to build a Soshi character who walks the path of the family’s founder and wields a powerful and dangerous shadow brand as their primary weapon and tool, make Dexterity and Wisdom your highest ability scores, followed by Charisma. Begin in the acolyte class, selecting the Acolyte of Shadows archetype. Choose a shadow brand that suits your preferred playstyle. Then take three levels of shinobi, choosing the Infiltrator archetype to improve your stealth skills.

Some storytellers act as historians, keeping memories and traditions alive through generations. Others see stories as the perfect vehicle for imparting wisdom and lessons to those in need of such things. Still other storytellers are entertainers, keeping crowds and distinguished guests rapt. The stories kept by storytellers can range in importance from a simple, cautionary tale to a secret, magical ritual. As adventurers, storytellers seek to transform their exploits into crafted tales to serve as they see fit. Skill Proficiencies: History, Performance Tool Proficiencies: Calligrapher’s supplies Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of calligrapher’s supplies, a leather-bound journal containing your stories, three bottles of ink, six quills, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Stories Wherever you go, you amass stories. Some stories change over time, and some are immutable as bedrock. You keep your stories in a large, leather‑bound book filled with scribbles and drops of ink. Alternatively, your stories are fixed in your mind, and for each story, you carry a small object to help you remember it. The object might be a souvenir from the event that inspired your story, a memento from the person who first taught you the story, a multi-faceted device whose many faces you count off as you tell each part of the story, or similar. If you spend at least one hour telling a story to an audience, you can receive minor gifts of appreciation for the story. These gifts are appropriate to the gift giver’s social and economic standing: a child might gift you a handful of picked wildflowers or a shiny rock they found, a passing noble captivated by your story might give you a few coins, or an innkeeper might gift you a discounted or free meal or room for entertaining their guests with your story. Alternatively, you can spend four hours telling stories at different locations within an urban center and earn enough to accommodate a modest lifestyle for that day. Regardless of the number of stories you tell in a day, you can earn these gifts from no more than one story each day, and you can earn enough to accommodate only a modest lifestyle each day. When crafting your stories, think about the story’s purpose and themes. Is it a historical recounting of a great feat among your people? Is it a tale of foolishness and wisdom meant to impart some lesson on its listener? Is it purely for entertainment with plenty of jokes and antics? Is it about overcoming obstacles or discovering a great truth? At the GM’s discretion, a story with a theme and purpose that aligns closely with the audience listening to the story might lead to larger gifts, might supply you with a comfortable lifestyle that day, or might earn you other campaign-specific rewards, such as earning the trust of a people or bolstering the morale of troops before a battle. Suggested Characteristics Storytellers consider themselves craftspeople similar to masons or blacksmiths. They are often outgoing if somewhat self-serious. While often charming, a storyteller’s tendency to see events as material for their next tale can strain some friendships and detach them slightly from the reality of a situation. d8 Personality Trait 1 I keep my community alive through telling their story. 2 I change my mind and mood on a whim to keep things interesting. 3 My work is important, and so am I. 4 Every breath is an opportunity to learn a new story. 5 I love people, especially when they are listening to me. 6 I have an endless amount of energy. 7 I despise the inauthentic—give me reality! 8 I have many friends, some of whom have names I can remember. d6 Ideal 1 Community.

Technologists are experts in repairing, tuning, and decommissioning the devices that other people rely on for their employment, comfort, and safety. Therefore, they are in constant demand everywhere, from heavily industrialized foundry worlds near the galactic core, to the Frontier worlds on the rim. Moreover, any ship of significant size is likely to employ engineers to keep it flying, regardless of where it finds itself in the ‘verse. Technologists come in all shapes and sizes, so there are lots of reasons why they might become adventurers. It could be that they are drawn to the challenge, or that they seek to uncover arcane secrets that can be incorporated into their machines.

The Inner Circle of Togashi The Inner Circle of Togashi is a distinguished organization within the Dragon Clan. Its members are sacred stewards of the answers to many of the mysteries of Togashi and Dragon origins. Hidden deep in the expanse of their private library, a chest of scrolls reveals what most of Rokugan has never known. The cherished mythological tale ‘The Children of Sun and Moon’ omits a truth that forever ties the Dragon Clan founder, Togashi, to his wayward brother, Fu Leng. Lady Sun’s heart was never earnestly won by Lord Moon, yet her obligation to him was clear. She promised him children, so children she gave him. Once, while Lady Sun was exploring the far reaches of the Heavens, she encountered a Lord from an unknown land he called Tian Guo. The Lord was well-versed in poetry, and soon his soft words and chestnut eyes brought out a brightness in her she had previously reserved. She bore two children with him. The first, she gave the name Togashi to conceal his parentage from Lord Moon. The second, her lover requested to be named Fu Leng after the tongue of his people. When Lady Sun revealed the name of her youngest son to Lord Moon, he raged. With one mighty burst of anger, he sealed their Heavens from the Heavens beyond so Lady Sun would never be able to see her lover again. Fu Leng was openly despised by Lord Moon. Though his siblings did not know of their mother’s dalliance, some of them ridiculed him for being so hated by their father, assuming he had done something to deserve Lord Moon’s wrath. Seeing the way Fu Leng was treated, Lady Sun never revealed Togashi shared the same father, except to Togashi himself. With him, she shared the philosophies of his father, and he used all she taught him to establish the Dragon Clan. Never feeling fully aligned with his half-siblings, Togashi secluded himself and his clan to the northern mountains, where he privately mourned the descent of Fu Leng and sought Enlightenment to bring him closer to his father and to the mortal land of his father’s creation, Yún Fēng Guó. The Heavens and mortal lands of the two countries have remained sealed by Lord Moon’s fierce action. Only the most determined travelers make the journey, and few survive to successfully cross to the other side. The most keenly enlightened members of the Inner Circle of Togashi have predicted through visions that they can soon conquer through a complex ritual. Currently, Inner Circle agents have been assigned to search for relics of Fu Leng in the Shadowlands, an area Dragon Clan members have long avoided due to the tragic nature of Fu Leng’s downfall. This has caused much tension with the Crab Clan who patrols the border of the Shadowlands. Not knowing the Inner Circle of Togashi’s true intentions, they see these agents as spiritual tourists and more of a liability than anything else. It is only with artifacts belonging to the two original descendants of Tian Guo in Rokugan, Togashi and Fu Leng, that a fissure through the mountains can be made, allowing safe passage and ancestral reconnection for Dragon Clan members who wish to learn more of their divine origins. Without such a fissure, travel remains exceptionally dangerous. Yún Fēng Guó is said to be a maze of spire-like mountains that punctuate a misty sky. It is a land rich in otherworldly gems and glistening rivers that carry a current of peculiar magic. The few Dragon Clan members throughout history who have successfully traveled to Yún Fēng Guó and survived the precarious mountain pass on their return have refused to disclose information with the Imperial Court, but share extraordinary tales of their journey with other Dragon Clan elite, encouraging them to keep striving to establish direct access.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Edge Studio","book":"Adventures in Rokugan"},{"name":"Tonbo Family - Dragonfly Clan","description":"Most Minor Clans have political relationships with their Great Clan neighbors, but the Dragonfly Clan is deeply enmeshed with the Dragon Clan, existing somewhere between a close ally and a vassal organization to the Dragon clan.

Having been exposed so directly to the harshest abuse and privations, no obstacle, fear, or hesitation will stop them now.

Feature: Tough Face You look so damn tough and intimidating that everyone you meet instantly realizes that you're no joke. When you interact with others using your Notoriety, you consider it 1 level higher. Suggested Characteristics In the Kingdom, the toughest of the tough come from Penumbria, the most violent and dangerous region in the Sinister Boot; many others originate from the worst neighborhoods of the worst cities in the Kingdom, from the depths of the poorest and most remote countryside, and from the most forbidding and isolated communities. The tough aren’t necessarily bad, but they’re certainly used to dealing with the bad guys, and should never be crossed lightly. d8 Personality Trait 1 I bow to no man, and I never apologize. 2 I have only two expressions: one with the hat, one without it. 3 There are tons of things that bother me, especially compliments. 4 I actually have a tender heart under this thick skin, but I do everything I can to hide it. 5 There's no such a thing as counting the money earned catching an infamous. 6 I believe people are monsters. I love animals, and I would never hurt them. 7 I can hardly stand others' company. I prefer to spend as much time alone as possible. 8 I never speak unless it is necessary. Oftentimes, one word is too many. d6 Ideal 1 Golden Heart. \"Inferno knows no fury like a good person turned bad.\" (Good) 2 Intransigence. If these are our orders, we must follow them, whatever the cost. (Lawful) 3 Cynicism. The world is falling apart, and we can't solve anybody's problems! Let's think about ourselves, fellas! (Chaotic) 4 Power. With blades as in life, the toughest wins. (Evil) 5 Oppportunism. With Frange or Altomagna, as long as I can have lasagna. (Neutral) 6 Loot. Let's fill our pockets and go have a drink somewhere. There are no other certainties in life. (Any) d6 Bond 1 The people worth dying for are those fighting by my side. 2 I've got a list of the people who did me wrong. I recite it every night before bed. 3 The only person who has ever loved me, the only one I will never forget. 4 I have been betrayed many times, but there is one particular betrayal that still weighs me down. I'll have my revenge. 5 I always carry an old yellowed bounty with me. On the bounty, there is the name of someone I have been chasing for a long time now. 6 My old captain. I haven't seen him for years, but a word from him would be all that it takes to put the old Company back on its feet. d6 Flaw 1 I have little respect for anybody who doesn't prove to be a good fighter. 2 I have seen too much, and my soul has wounds that cannot be healed. 3 I don't trust anyone, and I always sleep with one eye open. 4 If my life were at stake, I'd betray my companions in the blink of an eye. 5 I believe I'm not capable of loving anyone or anything, anymore. 6 I am bloodthirsty and violent to the point of brutality.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Acheron Games","book":"Brancalonia - Core Rulebook Compendium"},{"name":"Traded Child","description":"As a baby, you were traded to a hag, fiend, or other extraplanar bargain-maker. They raised you in a strange place, apart from others of your kind, to serve as a pawn in their schemes. Your unconventional childhood makes you a visitor in both the lands of your birth and your upbringing, able to navigate both, but at home in neither. When you choose this background, work with your GM to determine the circumstances of your youth. Who raised you and for what purpose? Do you know the terms of the exchange? Do you still serve the creature that raised you? If not, did you part on good terms? Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Survival Languages: Two of your choice; one from the land of your birth and one from the land of your upbringing Equipment: A token from your birth parents and a token from your guardian, a small knife, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Guardian, of Sorts Your guardian was a nefarious weaver of webs, and you were drawn into their schemes from an early age. Choose who raised you, and why, or roll on the table below. D8 Guardian 1 A pair of hags schooled me in dark rituals seeking to make me the third member of their coven. 2 A duplicitous devil trained me to be a clever and capable agent in their employ. 3 A fallen angel thought I would become a prophesied holy warrior and tried to corrupt me. 4 A sinister satyr used me as bait to lead other people into perilous situations. 5 A bloodthirsty fiend trained me to serve in their army. 6 A twisted spirit taught me to hunt intruders in the liminal spaces between the planes. 7 A vain fairy monarch trained me in subterfuge and tasked me with undermining their rivals. 8 A plane-traveling pirate raised me to be part of their crew. Option: Rejection Some traded children happily serve their guardians, while others yearn to be rid of them. Whether you rejected villainy or decided that you’d make a better villain on your own, if you left your guardian, choose how, or roll on the table below. D4 Rejection 1 You sabotaged one of your guardian’s schemes in a way that publicly humiliated them. 2 You defected to one of your guardian’s rivals. 3 You found a loophole in the pact that bound you to your guardian, invalidating the agreement. 4 You slipped away from your guardian’s home without being noticed and never looked back. Feature: Between Worlds You are tethered to both the plane of your birth and that of your upbringing. When you are on one of those planes, you instinctively know the distance and direction of the closest portal to the other plane, though your GM may rule that passing through the portal requires resources or rituals you don’t currently possess. Additionally, whenever you need to determine your native plane, such as for the banishment spell, you can choose either one. Finally, you always know when you are speaking to a creature from the plane you were raised in, even if the speaker is concealing their identity. Suggested Characteristics Traded children are raised without many of the cultural touchstones of their birth plane, and often struggle to fit in with their own kind. Owing to their harsh upbringings, they tend to be self-reliant and slow to trust. D8 Personality Trait 1 I use analogies and figures of speech from the plane where I was raised that don’t make sense elsewhere. 2 I can never know too many languages, collect too many contacts, or own too many maps. 3 I have visions of a place I’ve never been to and feel compelled to depict it in art. 4 I never make promises or sign contracts, even when I’m sure I would follow through. 5 I have an endless catalog of time-tested ruses and love to ply them. 6 I’m a helpless romantic for tales about found family. 7 I act like I’m negotiating a difficult contract even when a conversation is casual. 8 I hold myself to impossible standards and take pride in usually meeting them. D6 Ideal 1 Integrity. A contract is a contract. If I give my word, I always follow through. (Law) 2 Protection. The world needs to be defended from treacherous creatures like my guardian. (Good) 3 Schadenfreude. Everyone else should suffer the way I did, and I want to see it happen. (Evil) 4 Trickery. If you’re not smart enough to see through my schemes, then I deserve your wealth. (Evil) 5 Family. My family may not be conventional, but it’s worth fighting for. (Neutral) 6 Solace. I must work to make peace with who I was and what I’ve done. (Any) D6 Bond 1 I owe a great debt to my guardian. 2 I will find my birth parents and make them answer for abandoning me. 3 I grew up alongside another traded child who became my closest friend. 4 I grew up alongside another traded child who became my bitterest rival. 5 My birth parents gave me up to protect me from someone else. That person must be stopped. 6 I can only ever rely on myself; everything else could disappear in an instant. D6 Flaw 1 Agreements are meant to be exploited and twisted to my benefit. 2 I latch onto anyone that shows me kindness, even if I know that they are bad news. 3 I never tell anyone anything true about myself, even my real name, lest they use it against me later. 4 I don’t believe in compromise; someone has to win in every exchange. 5 I get visibly nervous around creatures that are smarter or cleverer than I am. 6 I am constantly hunted by either my guardian or their fiercest rival (choose one).","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Lone Colossus Games","book":"Injuries and Vile Deeds"},{"name":"Transformed","description":"Life is change, that's nothing new. But what happened to you goes far beyond normal life experiences. During the rebirth of your world in the dimension of Braythe, you went through a metamorphosis. Not just the world changed, you did - physically. After surviving the apocalypse, you were literally not the same person anymore. Maybe you liked the change, maybe you felt like your entire identity was stolen from you. In either case, you had to adapt, forced to find a new understanding of yourself, a new idea of who you are. This was tough, but it made you learn things: What truly defines a person, for example, or looking at things from different perspectives. Note that this background is designed specifically for characters that went through some kind of physical metamorphosis. If this isn't true for your character, work with your game master to adapt the background to your needs. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Survival Tool Proficiencies and Languages: Choose two of the following: Artisan's Tools, Gaming Set, Forgery Kit, one language Equipment: A pouch containing 5 gp A set of commoner's clothes A Diplomat's Pack or a Scholar's Pack Deep Insight: After you went through a metamorphosis, your path of finding your new self gave you a deep insight. This newfound wisdom gave you a better understanding of the mind or soul. This could help you be more resilient, or get along better with others, or even give you an edge in negotiations. Work with your game master to define the specific insight and how it might impact the campaign. Suggested characteristics: You might have lost yourself for a time - but you found your way again. You know more about who you are than before, and you are also good at understanding other people. This doesn't necessarily mean that you are very social, only that you are a good observer. Whether you are an introvert or an extrovert, you take your time for looking inward every day of your life. Traits I accept new challenges as a part of life. I trust that there is always a way out of trouble. I have found serenity. Even in the midst of chaos and disaster, I remain calm. I have found an important truth, and I love to share it. I understand that everyone has a reason for their behaviour - even if I disapprove of it. My understanding of the mind and soul helps me to influence others in ways that are helpful for me. I believe that I changed for a reason, a greater fate that has yet to unfold. Sometimes, I'm so deep in my own thoughts that I don't notice when others talk to me. The insights I found are only the beginning. I am at the start of an exciting journey of understanding. Ideals Wisdom. I seek to understand the nature of all living things to find the good in them. (Good) Logic. Emotions, needs, desires, the very nature of the soul - all this follows rules, and these rules can be understood. (Lawful) Curiosity. Everyone might have an interesting insight. I often talk with people or befriend them even if - or because - they are very different, possibly even have values and philosophies contradicting my own. (Chaotic) Manipulation. I love to understand others so I can better use them to achieve my own goals. (Evil) Tolerance. Everyone has reasons for their behaviour. I don't judge, even if I feel the need to act against them. (Neutral) Learning. Life means learning, and growing. Every observation I make is a chance for deeper understanding. (Any) Bonds I have found more questions than answers, and one of these questions bothers me every day. I dedicate my life to finding my truth. In my old life, I was involved in something evil. I changed, and now I seek to stop my former comrades. I believe that even the darkest villain is capable of goodness. I avoid to kill if I can, because every life has value. My family or the community I grew up in survived - but I was the only one who went through a metamorphosis. They pushed me away because I became so different, and I still suffer because of it. I believe that teaching children my insights is the best way to shape a better world, and I love to talk to them. I seek wisdom not just for myself. I am working on a series of books that I hope will one day change the world. Flaws I get distracted by people's stories. I might forget asking important questions because I focused on personal insights too much. I believe that my personal insights should be everyone's insights, and I push them onto others - whether they want to or not. I am so curious about others that I often ignore boundaries, and ask questions that are far too personal. I sometimes play with people's feelings just to see how they react. I have a terrible or shameful secret, and the people from my old life know about it. I have to avoid them at any cost. I have been changed to serve a great fate. This makes me more important than others.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":17295},"publisher":"Braythe RPG","book":"Braythe - Shattered Realities"},{"name":"Transformed Familiar","description":"Your connection to magic began with a term of service, or servitude, to a magician of power.

Everyone who supported my villainy left me and I became disillusioned with the path of evil. 3 Someone I respect showed me the error of my ways. 4 My nefarious schemes went horribly wrong and I reconsidered my life choices. 5 This is the first time in my life that it is safe for me to leave villainy behind. 6 I realized I don’t need villainy to get what I want. Variant Feature: Advocate To atone for your villainy, the people you hurt have asked you to use your power to benefit them. You can make compelling arguments driven by your intimate knowledge of the situation and your commitment to making things right. When you interact socially with others and you are trying to convince them to help you fulfill your promise, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks. Suggested Characteristics False apologizers are conscious of their reputations and are aware of what others might think of them. Some are guarded and insecure about their misdeeds, whereas others are more open and comfortable discussing their past. D8 Personality Trait 1 I proudly introduce myself as a former villain everywhere I go, and I enjoy the shocked reaction I receive every time. 2 I dress in unremarkable, plain clothing to show humility and sincerity, and I keep my weapons hidden. 3 I always tip shopkeepers and service workers. 4 I am unerringly polite, even when I am insulted. 5 I rarely apologize for mundane mistakes because I don’t want to cheapen the meaning of the apology for my villainy. 6 I can hold my own in battle against enemies three times my size. I’m confident in my combat prowess. I believe I can win any fight, no matter the odds. 7 I don’t help others for praise or thanks, but I never turn down a compliment. 8 I’m used to having others do things for me and I fumble with basic tasks. D6 Ideal 1 Choices. Actions matter more than words. (Any) 2 Honesty. Everyone must know the truth about what I did and what I am doing to atone for it. (Good) 3 Indifference. Third-party opinions are unimportant and irrelevant. (Neutral) 4 Justice. Those who were wronged should decide the perpetrator’s fate. (Lawful) 5 Power. Only the foolish accept apologies. (Evil) 6 Self-image. I’ll put myself in harm’s way if it makes me look more sympathetic. (Chaotic) D6 Bond 1 No matter how notorious I become, the people closest to me know who I really am, and that is all that matters. 2 The people I hurt deserve everything I can give them, and more. I care only for myself and my good deeds are incidental.. 3 My victims gave me a second chance, and I will never forget their kindness. 4 My life belongs to the community I serve. 5 I must impress someone of a higher social standing than me. 6 The people in my hometown face unfair prejudices because of me and I’ll correct that. D6 Flaw 1 I miss my days of true villainy, when I had the power to do what I wanted with impunity. 2 I could walk away from my apology any time I want, and I am sometimes tempted to do so. 3 I talk about my villainous past a bit too casually. 4 I’m still not used to being held accountable and my immediate impulse is to defend myself from any accusation. 5 Being told that my efforts aren’t good enough puts me in a foul mood. 6 I constantly have to curb my desire to be the center of attention.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Lone Colossus Games","book":"Injuries and Vile Deeds"},{"name":"Tsuruchi's Warband - Wasp Clan","description":"Commanded by the famed bounty hunter Tsuruchi, the Wasp Clan is a group of mercenaries that has found itself elevated to the status of Minor Clan thanks to the political machinations of the Imperial Court.

Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren’t a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You’re involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What’s more, you aren’t alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed. You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves’ guilds and street gangs. You might be a “velvet mask” bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faerûn’s great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur’s Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar—any place that’s large enough to have a steady supply of potential quarries. As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn’t fit with the group’s objectives—but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.

These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the criminal background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your bounty hunter’s traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a bounty hunter. For instance, your bond might involve other bounty hunters or the organizations or individuals that employ you. Your ideal could be associated with your determination always to catch your quarry or your desire to maintain your reputation for being dependable.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide"},{"name":"Urchin","description":"You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor.

You’ve survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, stre⁠⁠ngth, speed, or some combination of each.

When you are not in com⁠bat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.

You learned these principles, and much more, as a member of an Uthgardt tribe. Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization. You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had decided to settle down, and now that they have abandoned that path, you find yourself adrift. Or you might come from a segment of the Uthgardt that adheres to tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by achieving great things as a formidable adventurer. See the “Uthgardt Lands” section of chapter 2 for details on each tribe’s territory and its activities that will help you choose your affiliation. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument or artisan’s tools Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A hunting trap, a totemic token or set of tattoos marking your loyalty to Uthgar and your tribal totem, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Barbarian Tribes of Faerûn Though this section details the Uthgardt specifically, either it or the outlander background from the Player’s Handbook can be used for a character whose origin lies with one of the other barbarian tribes in Faerûn. You might be a fair-haired barbarian of the Reghed, dwelling in the shadow of the Reghed Glacier in the far North near Icewind Dale. You might also be of the nomadic Rashemi, noted for their savage berserkers and their masked witches. Perhaps you hail from one of the wood elf tribes in the Chondalwood, or the magic-hating human tribes of the sweltering jungles of Chult. Feature: Uthgardt Heritage You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe’s territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the North. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there. Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of your people, and those folk allied with your tribe, often including members of druid circles, tribes of nomadic elves, the Harpers, and the priesthoods devoted to the gods of the First Circle. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of an Uthgardt tribe. Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not countenance such an act being done in your presence. The Uthgardt ancestral mounds—great hills where the totem spirits were defeated by Uthgar and where the heroes of the tribes are interred—are sacred to you. Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe or some aspect of Uthgardt philosophy or culture (perhaps even Uthgar himself). Your ideal is a personal choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your people and certainly doesn’t contradict or compromise what being an Uthgardt stands for.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide"},{"name":"Vagabond","description":"","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Jeff Stevens Games","book":"Potbellied Kobold"},{"name":"Veteran Soldier","description":"The Last Age is an age of constant warfare. All of the lands of Eredane are mobilized for total war, and nearly every individual capable of fighting has been drafted into the armies. The elves and dwarves both throw themselves into a desperate struggle for survival, while in the north, the orcs have long since been forced to live in a completely militarized society. Even in the occupied lands, many humans are drafted into Izrador’s armies or fight as mercenaries, while plenty of refugees have joined the free armies to fight for their adopted homes. You are a veteran of that ongoing war, whether you are still a member of a military, or have long since left the ranks. Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Perception Weapon Proficiencies: One martial weapon of your choice Equipment: A uniform with an insignia of rank, a sturdy pair of boots, a bedroll, a backpack, and one week of trail rations Feature: Military Rank You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your current or former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment for temporary use, and you usually gain access to friendly camps and fortresses. However, the higher your former rank, the more your enemies want to kill you, or to capture and interrogate you. The armies of the elves and dwarves are worn down and have been bled dry over a century of fighting. Most soldiers in them are weary veterans, and new recruits learn quickly or die. In these armies, veterancy is respected almost as much as rank, and many people of higher rank have the experience to accompany it. Amongst the Shadow’s rigid military structure, rank is earned by killing foes and then challenging a former officer to a duel. These duels are always to the death. Variant Feature: Old Veteran If your character has the veteran soldier background, you may select this background feature instead of Military Rank. You’ve had plenty of experience with the army you left, and a lot of it gave you knowledge of the many ways in which the organization is dysfunctional. You can pretend to be a member of that military organization, and you always know how to find those among the ranks who sell contraband; soldiers who can be easily bribed; and soldiers willing to trade weapons, armor, or other military equipment in exchange for small luxuries. However, if discovered, you face execution. None of the armies in the Last Age look favorably on deserters. Variant Veteran Soldier: Deserter Though you were once a soldier, you could no longer fight in the unending meat grinder of war. Perhaps you were tired of the slaughter and just had to leave. Or perhaps, as with orcs who realized just how much the Shadow was using them, you realized you could no longer fight in the name of an evil oppressor. Regardless, you left your military posting without permission, even though you knew it would cost you your life if you were caught. If you decide that you are a soldier who deserted from your former the military organization, you may choose the Old Veteran feature instead of the Military Rank feature. Suggested Characteristics The horrors of constant war and the unending struggle against the Shadow leave their mark on soldiers, no matter what side they fight on. d8 Personality Trait 1 I keep a tally of each foe I kill and will tell you about each one. 2 I’m haunted by my experiences in the war and feel like I can never escape reminders of the conflict. 3 I have no patience for new recruits or those who are raw and untested on the battlefield. 4 There’s the way you were taught to do things, and there’s the way I’ve learned to do them. You don’t have to listen to me, but my way will keep you alive. 5 I stay quiet and polite.

To this day, I attempt to live up to that childhood ideal. 4 I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. 5 I remember every inch of ground we have lost in this war. One day I will reclaim it all. 6 I rarely make an oath, but when I do, I stick by it. d6 Flaw 1 I have no time for someone who hasn’t fought in this war. 2 Fear still grips me whenever I see the enemy, just like the time it caused me to flee the battlefield. 3 I’ll do anything to defeat the enemy, even if it endangers others. 4 In war, mercy is a liability. 5 I’m blind to the mistakes and flaws of my people or the military I serve. 6 I hide my emotions behind crude jokes and rude comments lest others get too close.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Edge Studio","book":"Midnight - Legacy of Darkness"},{"name":"Village Healer","description":"From a young age, you were adept at healing those who were infirm.

It should never be wasted. d6 Flaw 1 I sample my own work a little too often. 2 I'm a snob when it comes to wine. And food. And music. And lodgings. And people. 3 I resent anyone who doesn't love my wine. 4 I love gossip, and can't resist spreading rumors. 5 I pretend to be more important and well-connected than I am. 6 I'm a perfectionist.

You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidate) checks against those aware of your past, and most criminals and bandits will have a starting attitude of indifferent toward you. On the other hand, people like lawmakers and town guards will initially be hostile toward you until you can prove yourself to be trustworthy.

Human families who jealously guard their privilege and place in the City of Splendors, Waterdhavian nobles have a reputation across Faerûn for being eccentric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich. Whether you are a shining example of the reason for this reputation or one who proves the rule by being an exception, people expect things of you when they know your surname and what it means. Your reasons for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delving in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have you taken up sword or spell on your family’s behalf, ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to their legacy? Work with your DM to come up with the family you are part of —there are around seventy-five lineages in Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, specialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one day. Or you might be one of any number of cousins, with less prestige but also less responsibility. Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or one musical instrument Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring or brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine zzar or wine, and a purse containing 20 gp Feature: Kept in Style While you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North, your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family’s estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe. This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income—the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the noble background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of a Waterdhavian family. Like other nobles, you were born and raised in a different world from the one that most folk know—one that grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty befitting your station. Your bond might be associated with your family alone, or it could be concerned with another noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in the world at large as a representative of your house.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds","Expansion":6286},"publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","book":"Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide"},{"name":"Wayfarer","description":"Ability Scores Dexterity, Wisdom, Charisma Feat Lucky Skill Proficiencies Insight and Stealth Tool Proficiency Thieves’ Tools Equipment Choose A or B: (A) 2 Daggers, Thieves’ Tools, Gaming Set (any), Bedroll, 2 Pouches, Traveler’s Clothes, 16 GP; or (B) 50 GP You grew up on the streets surrounded by similarly ill-fated castoffs, a few of them friends and a few of them rivals.

You are also entrusted with a solemn duty—to never let the secrets of your liege-lord’s deadly creations fall into the wrong hands. You might have come to Whitestone to prove yourself worthy of wielding the secretive and highly coveted firearms created there, and to seek instruction from warriors who have mastered those weapons. Or you might have grown up in Whitestone, perhaps even remembering the brutal days when Lord and Lady Briarwood ruled your homeland—a reign that began some thirty years ago and lasted for six harrowing years. Alternatively, you or your parents might have come to Whitestone as refugees fleeing the destruction of the Chroma Conclave’s attack on Tal’Dorei. If so, your life in the city-state might have been a relatively peaceful one, dwelling among the engineers, artisans, and merchants seeking to capitalize upon Whitestone’s reputation as an up-and-coming center of trade, culture, and invention. When you choose this background, decide whether you were a member of the Rifle Corps, the Pale Guard, or the Whitestone Hunters. The “Whitestone” section in chapter 3 has more information about the Pale Guard, as well as the armaments and militia in the city-state. See below for more information on the Whitestone Hunters. Skill Proficiencies: Your choice of two of the following: Athletics, Perception, or Survival Weapon Proficiencies: Firearms Languages: One of your choice Equipment: Your choice of a musket or a pistol, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Feature: Legacy of Secrecy You have been entrusted with the use and care of a weapon both powerful and terrifying. The rifle you wield might transform the face of warfare and life in Tal’Dorei. It is a weapon that haunts the mind of its creator, Percival de Rolo, manifesting as a pain that lives always behind his kind eyes. You were granted a musket or a pistol (as described in the fifth edition core rules) by your commander in the Whitestone Rifle Corps. This weapon is a symbol of your status, and when you display it, other folk around you—particularly adventurers, mercenaries, guards, engineers, and weapons enthusiasts—treat you differently. You might be seen as a noble defender of the people, a selfish hoarder of power, or anything in between, at the GM’s discretion. Feature: Rifle Corps Relationship You are—or were—a member of an elite and trusted band of Whitestone’s staunchest defenders. Work with your GM to determine your current relationship with the Rifle Corps. If your campaign starts in Whitestone, you might be an active member of that unit. Otherwise, you can use the Rifle Corps Relationships table for suggestions. Rifle Corps Relationships d6 Current Relationship 1 I retired honorably from the Rifle Corps—and now it’s time for me to pursue my own adventures. 2 I’m on an important mission to protect Whitestone or guard one of our allies. 3 Whitestone is in trouble, and I was sent away to seek help. 4 I don’t think firearms technology should be kept secret, so I escaped from the Rifle Corps with my weapon and am on the run. 5 I was on a mission with my company when I got separated from them. Now I need to find my way back home. 6 My weapon was stolen. I built a new one, but I can’t return home until I’ve tracked down the thief and recovered the original. (Whitestone Hunter variant only) Suggested Characteristics Those who join the Whitestone Rifle Corps become members of an elite and trusted band known as the city-state’s staunchest defenders. But this means working with your GM to determine why you’re not at home protecting Whitestone. Perhaps you took on a mission to guard someone on behalf of the de Rolo family, or you might have been separated from your company while on an assignment. Either way, you find yourself embroiled now in a series of new adventures as you try to make your way back home. Your bond is likely associated with your comrades-in-arms or with Whitestone itself. Your ideal could be tied to justice or protection, but could also be a secretive, selfish perversion of those virtues. Rifle Corps Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I want to make a good impression at all times. That means keeping my clothes and gear clean and in top condition. 2 I don’t like being the center of attention. I’d rather let someone else do the talking while I watch their back. 3 I feel safe only if I’m carrying my trusty rifle. And my dagger. And my concealed pistol. Oh, and of course my…. 4 I don’t trust people with my secrets easily, so it feels like a big deal when someone else shares a secret with me. 5 I like coming up with solutions to problems using my esoteric knowledge of natural philosophy. 6 Everyone around me takes things so seriously. Sometimes I just want to let loose and have fun! 7 Knowing things that other people don’t know makes me feel special and important. 8 I’m most at home in woods and mountains, where everything feels at once familiar, always growing and changing. Rifle Corps Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Responsibility. I have a duty to protect the people of Whitestone and to uphold the trust placed in me by the de Rolos. (Lawful) 2 Militarization. Everyone should have access to the most powerful weapons available, so they can defend themselves effectively. (Evil) 3 Cooperation. Any problem can be solved as long as people are willing to work together. (Good) 4 Camaraderie. It’s important to have people you can trust to help out in a fight—and to uncork a bottle together afterward. (Any) 5 Context. There are no universal rights or wrongs. Every choice depends on the details of the situation. (Chaotic) 6 Secrecy. Information is valuable, but it can also be dangerous. I’ll keep my mouth shut and gather as much intel as I can. (Neutral) Rifle Corps Bonds d6 Bond 1 I never knew what to do with myself until I joined the Rifle Corps. Now I have a purpose and comrades to give me direction. 2 One of my fellow Rifle Corps soldiers saved my life—and then I saved theirs. That kind of bond lasts forever. 3 Whitestone is the best city in all of Tal’Dorei. Nowhere else has been blessed by the Dawnfather and has a clock that tracks the movement of the stars! 4 My quick thinking saved a noble from assassination, and she showed me great kindness in return. I daren’t say it, but I’m more loyal to her than I am to the de Rolos. 5 My weapon is my life. I clean it, repair it, and care for it—and it serves me loyally in return. 6 The people of Whitestone cared for my family when we had nothing. I promise to repay their compassion with my service. Rifle Corps Flaws d6 Flaw 1 Who cares about keeping this gun safe? “Don’t let it fall into the wrong hands!” Ha! It’s only a matter of time before someone slips up and these weapons are everywhere. 2 I think being part of the Rifle Corps is so cool. I love telling people about my position so I can impress them. 3 My weapon was stolen. I built a new one, but I can’t return home until I’ve tracked down the thief and recovered the original. 4 I’m tired of protecting spoiled people who don’t know how to protect themselves. 5 I shoot first and ask questions later. 6 The first and only time I killed someone, it changed my life. I still dream about it, and I’ll never be the carefree person I was before. Variant: Whitestone Hunter As elite as they are, the members of the Whitestone Rifle Corps do not represent the apex of firearms skill in Whitestone. A clandestine group of elite soldiers and survivalists is drawn secretly from the Rifle Corps ranks. Called the Whitestone Hunters, these soldiers are special operatives of the de Rolo family, and loyally serve as spies, bodyguards, and even assassins when the job requires it. Though few officially know of them, rumors of the Whitestone Hunters’ existence swirl constantly throughout the city-state, often in response to their activities after having been loaned out to protect Whitestone’s allies. You are one of these Whitestone Hunters, even if just a trainee (if you’re starting your campaign at low levels).

Language : Common. This is the only language you know, regardless of your race, and you still speak in broken sentences. Equipment : A set of makeshift clothes, a pouch, a club, a torch, and a trinket from the wild.

Rather than facing the Shadow, these individuals saw the war as lost and fled into the wilds. You are a descendant of these wildlanders, and long ago you learned that the occupied cities were just as dangerous as the wilderness lands. However, you are well aware of the history of how your ancestors fled the Shadow. Whether you felt they made the right decision at the time or you are ashamed of what you perceive as cowardice, you know the time to fight back has now come. Skill Proficiencies: Perception, Survival Languages: Trader’s Tongue, plus one other of your choice Equipment: A staff, a set of sturdy traveler’s clothes, a backpack, two weeks of trail rations, and a hunting trap Feature: Survivalist The lands of Eredane are rugged and wild, and they become more dangerous each year. You know how to survive in these lands and what threats to avoid. You always know when you are near natural predators or hostile creatures such as monstrosities, the Fell, or the Fallen, and you can tell when lands are blighted by magic. If there is a best route to avoid encountering these, you know what that is as well. You can also always find shelter from bad weather. Finally, you know when an animal is acting suspiciously (for instance, if it has been possessed by an astirax). Suggested Characteristics Some who live in Eredane still resent wildlanders for their ancestors’ “betrayal.” Others see wildlanders as dangerous and untrustworthy. In turn, most wildlanders dislike and fear the occupied cities, as they see visiting them as a good way to be killed or captured out of hand by the Shadow’s armies. Even the last free cities of the elves and dwarves are unpleasant, desperate places that are only good for huddling in until the Shadow’s armies arrive. d8 Personality Trait 1 I can survive better in the wild places of Eredane than I can in any city, and I can ensure the Shadow will never find me there. 2 I always let someone else speak first, so I can gauge what they have to say. 3 I have no patience for people who can’t survive on their own. 4 When I get angry at someone, I tend to growl at them. 5 Stillness is survival. I can spend hours without moving a muscle so that I go unnoticed. 6 I like chatting and joking with people, even if I’m not very good at understanding social cues! 7 Although most people don’t trust animals because of the Shadow’s minions, I love all manner of beasts and show them affection that I don’t show people. 8 I tend to offer the simplest and most direct solution to any problem. d6 Ideal 1 Nature: The gods may have abandoned Aryth, but in the wild spaces I manage to find a kind of divinity. (Neutral) 2 Adaptability: As the Shadow continues to cover Eredane, we must be quick to change in order to survive.

(Evil) 4 Balance: Izrador is too strong, and his minions have overthrown the natural order. He must be beaten back so that the wilderness can survive. (Lawful) 5 Life: The Shadow brings death and disease. In the wilderness, far from it’s reach, life continues, and I work to ensure that is always the case.

When a chick is born with special markings or unique feather patterns, or when they survive a dramatic childhood event, some folks brand them “Wind-Touched”. Though a few dismiss the notion of the Wind-Touched as superstition, others heap reverence upon those believed chosen. According to legend, one who is touched by the wind will never feel at ease anywhere but high in the forest canopy, with the wind in their feathers. Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance Tool Proficiencies: one type of wind Musical Instrument Languages: you can speak as well as understand Auran Equipment: a wind Musical Instrument (one of your choice), an ornate cloak, a symbol of the wind, common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Title and Blessing For some birdfolk, the moniker of Wind-Touched is merely a title, a symbol of their devotion to the wind and the natural world. Others have been told since birth that they were blessed by the wind, much in the way the Amaranthine Reya was in the old tales. Decide what your character believes, or roll on the table below to understand how they feel. d6 Acceptance 1 I am truly blessed and have power over the wind itself. 2 I am devoted to the wind spirits, in action and title. 3 I believe in nature and goodness. 4 I will work tirelessly to earn the respect of those who give me this title. 5 I accept this honor but have my doubts. 6 I feel nothing for this title, and carry it against my will. Feature: Supernatural Presence Whether or not you are truly Wind-Touched, there are folk all across Everden that believe that you have been divinely blessed. If you make a show of power or skill that can be attributed to the wind or air, such as feats of acrobatics or commanding unseen forces, those believers will be bolstered by your supernatural presence. They will support you and, depending on how well you have convinced them of your powers, treat you with reverence and possibly even worship. Suggested Characteristics The wind-touched are revered by believers and scrutinized by skeptics. For better or worse, they find themselves in a world of expectations they struggle to live up to. d8 Personality Trait 1 I never back down from a challenge. 2 I always end up being the center of attention. 3 I am gifted by the wind and destined for greatness. 4 I have no time for those who doubt me. 5 I seek out challenges to test myself. 6 I am better than everyone else. 7 I avoid showing my power at all costs. 8 I remain humble despite my blessing. d6 Ideal 1 Responsibility. The powers I have been gifted with are meant to serve the common good. (Good) 2 Heroism. The wind chose me to be a brave warrior and leader, so shall it be. (Lawful) 3 Egotism. My powers situate me above others. The masses should know their place. (Evil) 4 Mysticism. Connected to nature, I speak for the wind and divine its will for others. (Neutral) 5 Cynicism. What matters isn’t whether or not my powers are genuine, but what advantages I can reap because of that belief. (Evil) 6 Naturalism. The wind speaks to my soul, and I am bound to go wherever it directs me. (Chaotic) d6 Bond 1 I am guided by a wise elder who prepares me for my destiny. 2 I am estranged from my parents who don’t believe in my blessing. 3 I seek to discredit the person who burdened me with this moniker. 4 I live in the shadow of my mentor, seeking their approval. 5 I have a sibling who is not blessed, which causes tension. 6 I am one with the wind. Personal relationships are fleeting. d6 Flaw 1 I can’t accept another’s suggestion once I’ve set my path. 2 I expect nothing less than reverence from common people. 3 I blindly trust in the power of my blessing. 4 I am overly concerned about how others see me. 5 I will prove my worth, even if it means putting myself and my friends in danger. 6 I am burdened with responsibility, and find it hard to make even the simplest decisions. Coupled with Power While this background primarily focuses on the beliefs and perceptions of yourself and your community, pairing this background with a character who actually can manipulate the wind through magic could potentially set them up to become a holy figure, a prophet, or a fabled hero.","properties":{"Category":"Backgrounds"},"publisher":"Hit Point Press","book":"Humblewood"},{"name":"Witchlight Hand","description":"You crept into the Witchlight Carnival as a child or youth and never looked back, earning a place among those who work behind the scenes to keep the carnival in business. As a hand, you work hard and party hard. The carnival has borne you to many fantastic worlds, circling back around to your home world once every eight years, but you know almost nothing about these worlds because you spend all your time in the carnival. You know the other hands well, but the carnival’s owners—Mister Witch and Mister Light—remain mysterious to you even after all these years. Maybe you joined the carnival to escape a dismal life at home, or maybe you were enchanted by the idea of visiting new places or the dream of becoming one of the carnival’s star attractions. Now that you’re older, carnival life has lost some of its appeal. The daily routine has grown tedious, the cyclical nature of the carnival’s journey monotonous.

Character Traits As the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters’ personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the Player’s Handbook , or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn’t make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table.

I will do whatever it takes to get what I want, regardless of the harm it might cause. (Evil) Bonds d8 Bond 1 I would never break my word. 2 I find magic in all its forms to be compelling. The more magical a place, the more I am drawn to it. 3 I do what I can to protect the natural world. 4 A trusted friend is the most important thing in the multiverse to me. 5 I can’t bring myself to harm a Fey creature, either because I consider myself one or because I fear the repercussions. 6 The Witchlight Carnival feels like home to me. 7 I’m drawn to the Feywild and long to return there, if only for a short while. 8 I feel indebted to Mister Witch and Mister Light for giving me a home and a purpose. Flaws d8 Flaw 1 I easily lose track of time. My poor sense of time means I’m always late. 2 I think the whole multiverse is out to get me. 3 I’m always operating under a tight timeline, and I’m obsessed with keeping everything on schedule. 4 I’m a kleptomaniac who covets shiny, sparkling treasure. 5 I’m forgetful.

Xiē Lóng Gǔ, or the Valley of Slumbering Dragons as inhabitants of Rokugan often refer to it, can only be entered or exited via a series of tunnels both natural and man-made that extend through the neighboring mountain ranges. Xiē Lóng Gǔ is the most heavily guarded place in Yún Fēng Guó. The bodies of the land’s emperors are interred here in palatial tombs made entirely of spirit jade. Many imperial bodyguards choose to guard their emperors past death. Through spirit jade alchemy and magics unknown to Rokugan, they are transformed into imposing clay golems, immune to the rigors of time as they take up their post defending the tunnels, city, and palace of tombs. The people of Yún Fēng Guó believe that the many gods of the Heavens will one day walk among mortals and wage wars of cataclysmic proportions. When that day comes, their fallen emperors will arise to defend and lead their people in the ensuing chaos. Lured by the promise of gold, magical artifacts, and spirit jade in the emperor’s tombs, many bandits dream of entering the valley and leaving with its wealth.
