## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Install the package via npm:
```bash
npm install dnd-data
```

Pull in the data:

```js
const { spells, monsters, items } = require('dnd-data');

console.log(spells.length); // Outputs: 5849

const { name, description, properties, publisher, book } = monsters[526]

console.log(items[42]) // Outputs
{
	name: 'Abyssal Bane Greataxe',
	description: 'Weapon (any melee), uncommon Component: fiend (demon) bone Fashioned of bone, stone, and demon eyes, abyssal weapons are gestated by unholy bonesmiths within the infernal depths of the Hells. Fortified by magic to prevent the brittle materials from shattering, such weapons are carved with the true name of the demon whose eyes were ‚Äòdonated‚Äô to its conception. The power of such a weapon is linked to the number of eyes used to craft it, with each open eye representing one unexpended charge. This weapon has 2 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Bonerip. As a bonus action when you hit a target with this weapon, you can call the name of the demon to whom the eyes belonged and expend 1 charge. The weapon mobilises, boney teeth and necrotic energy ripping through the target‚Äôs defences. The target gains a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to its AC. Its AC can‚Äôt be reduced to less than 10 + its Dexterity modifier. The target can repair its armour with enough rest (for natural armour) or at an appropriate armoursmith‚Äôs (for worn armour) at the GM‚Äôs discretion.',
	properties: {
		Category: 'Items',
		'Item Type': 'Weapon (greataxe)',
		Properties: 'Heavy, two-handed',
		'Item Rarity': 'uncommon'
	},
	publisher: 'Loot Tavern',
	book: 'L‚ÄôArsene‚Äôs Ledger of Treasures and Trinkets'
}
```

The `name`, `description`, `publisher` and `book` key, value pairs are consistent across all datasets.

The `properties` value changes depending on the data set you pull in. So for example a spell might have the following value:

```js
{
  Category: 'Spells',
  Save: 'Dexterity',
  Level: 1,
  School: 'evocation',
  Expansion: 29025,
  Components: 'V, S, M',
  'Damage Type': 'acid',
  'Casting Time': '1 action',
  'data-RangeAoe': '60 feet '
}
```

Where an item may have the following value:

```js
{
  Category: 'Items',
  'Item Type': 'Staff',
  'Item Rarity': 'rare',
  'Requires Attunement': 'Requires Attunement'
}
```
